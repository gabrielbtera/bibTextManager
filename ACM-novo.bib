abstract = {A fiduciary is a trusted agent that has the legal duty to act with loyalty and care towards a principal that employs them. When fiduciary organizations interact with users through a digital interface, or otherwise automate their operations with artificial intelligence, they will need to design these AI systems to be compliant with their duties. This article synthesizes recent work in computer science and law to develop a procedure for designing and auditing Fiduciary AI. The designer of a Fiduciary AI should understand the context of the system, identify its principals, and assess the best interests of those principals. Then the designer must be loyal with respect to those interests, and careful in an contextually appropriate way. We connect the steps in this procedure to dimensions of Trustworthy AI, such as privacy and alignment. Fiduciary AI is a promising means to address the incompleteness of data subject’s consent when interacting with complex technical systems.},

abstract = {Data provenance, a record that describes the origins and processing of data, offers new promises in the increasingly important role of artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems in guiding human decision making. To avoid disastrous outcomes that can result from bias-laden AI systems, responsible AI builds on four important characteristics: fairness, accountability, transparency, and explainability. To stimulate further research on data provenance that enables responsible AI, this study outlines existing biases and discusses possible implementations of data provenance to mitigate them. We first review biases stemming from the data's origins and pre-processing. We then discuss the current state of practice, the challenges it presents, and corresponding recommendations to address them. We present a summary highlighting how our recommendations can help establish data provenance and thereby mitigate biases stemming from the data's origins and pre-processing to realize responsible AI-based systems. We conclude with a research agenda suggesting further research avenues.},

Imperfect delegation challenges human accountability. We hold that both direct public accountability via public transparency and indirect public accountability via transparency to auditors in public organizations can be both instrumentally ethically valuable and required as a matter of deontology from the principle of democratic self-government. We analyze the regulatory content of 16 guideline documents about the use of AI in the public sector, by mapping their requirements to those of our philosophical account of accountability, and conclude that while some guidelines refer processes that amount to auditing, it seems that the debate would benefit from more clarity about the nature of the entitlement of auditors and the goals of auditing, also in order to develop ethically meaningful standards with respect to which different forms of auditing can be evaluated and compared.},

By using the intelligent case handling system to assist judges in handling cases, on the one hand, it can effectively alleviate the problem of many cases but few judges in Chinese courts, thereby improving judicial efficiency; on the other hand, judges can retrieve information about similar cases on the judgment document management platform. This can promote the unification of the law and protect the judges to exercise their discretion. However, the scope of use of artificial intelligence technology should be controlled in judicial judgments. Under the conditions of following the provisions of judicial judgments, based on China's national conditions and judicial practice experience, set up legal and reasonable regulations and procedures.

abstract = {As machine learning powered decision-making becomes increasingly important in our daily lives, it is imperative to strive for fairness in the underlying data processing. We propose a pre-processing algorithm for fair data representation via which supervised learning results in estimations of the Pareto frontier between prediction error and statistical disparity. In particular, the present work applies the optimal affine transport to approach the post-processing Wasserstein barycenter characterization of the optimal fair L2-objective supervised learning via a pre-processing data deformation. Furthermore, we show that the Wasserstein geodesics from the conditional (on sensitive information) distributions of the learning outcome to their barycenter characterize the Pareto frontier between L2-loss and the average pairwise Wasserstein distance among sensitive groups on the learning outcome. Numerical simulations underscore the advantages: (1) the pre-processing step is compositive with arbitrary conditional expectation estimation supervised learning methods and unseen data; (2) the fair representation protects the sensitive information by limiting the inference capability of the remaining data with respect to the sensitive data; (3) the optimal affine maps are computationally efficient even for high-dimensional data.},

Cyber threats are growing at an explosive pace making the existing security and privacy measures inadequate. Hence, everyone on the Internet is a product for hackers. Consequently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to produce accurate outputs from large complex databases, where the generated outputs can be used to predict and detect vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems. Furthermore, Blockchain (BC) techniques are becoming popular in modern IoT applications to solve security and privacy issues. Several studies have been conducted on either ML algorithms or BC techniques. However, these studies target either security or privacy issues using ML algorithms or BC techniques, thus posing a need for a combined survey on efforts made in recent years addressing both security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques. In this article, we provide a summary of research efforts made in the past few years, from 2008 to 2019, addressing security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain. First, we discuss and categorize various security and privacy threats reported in the past 12 years in the IoT domain. We then classify the literature on security and privacy efforts based on ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain. Finally, we identify and illuminate several challenges and future research directions using ML algorithms and BC techniques to address security and privacy issues in the IoT domain.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to make decisions in our society. ML models, however, can be unfair to certain demographic groups (e.g., African Americans or females) according to various fairness metrics. Existing techniques for producing fair ML models either are limited to the type of fairness constraints they can handle (e.g., preprocessing) or require nontrivial modifications to downstream ML training algorithms (e.g., in-processing).We propose a declarative system OmniFair for supporting group fairness in ML. OmniFair features a declarative interface for users to specify desired group fairness constraints and supports all commonly used group fairness notions, including statistical parity, equalized odds, and predictive parity. OmniFair is also model-agnostic in the sense that it does not require modifications to a chosen ML algorithm. OmniFair also supports enforcing multiple user declared fairness constraints simultaneously while most previous techniques cannot. The algorithms in OmniFair maximize model accuracy while meeting the specified fairness constraints, and their efficiency is optimized based on the theoretically provable monotonicity property regarding the trade-off between accuracy and fairness that is unique to our system.We conduct experiments on commonly used datasets that exhibit bias against minority groups in the fairness literature. We show that OmniFair is more versatile than existing algorithmic fairness approaches in terms of both supported fairness constraints and downstream ML models. OmniFair reduces the accuracy loss by up to 94.8% compared with the second best method. OmniFair also achieves similar running time to preprocessing methods, and is up to 270x faster than in-processing methods.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the deployment of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques based on transformer technology, across many domains and applications. However, in legal domains, due to the complexity, length, and sparsity of legal case documents, the use of these advanced NLP techniques has offered comparatively slight returns. Perhaps even more importantly, such methods are critically lacking in explainability and justification of outputs, which are essential for many legal applications. We propose that the direction of these NLP techniques should be aimed at ascription to a legal knowledge model, which can then provide the necessary and auditable justifications for the rationale of any case outcome. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of using Hierarchical Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (H-BERT) models to ascribe to an Angelic Domain Model (ADM) that is able to represent the legal knowledge of a domain in a structured way, enabling justifications and improving performance. Our study involved an annotation task on a popular domain, cases from the European Court of Human Rights, to gain an understanding of the balance of complaints in the domain. The data set produced from this study enabled training of models for factor ascription using the classification targets derived from the annotations. We present results of experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the ascription task at three different levels of abstraction within the structured model.},

abstract = {Intelligent Computing for Interactive System Design provides a comprehensive resource on what has become the dominant paradigm in designing novel interaction methods, involving gestures, speech, text, touch and brain-controlled interaction, embedded in innovative and emerging human–computer interfaces. These interfaces support ubiquitous interaction with applications and services running on smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle systems, virtual and augmented reality, robotic systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), and many other domains that are now highly competitive, both in commercial and in research contexts.This book presents the crucial theoretical foundations needed by any student, researcher, or practitioner working on novel interface design, with chapters on statistical methods, digital signal processing (DSP), and machine learning (ML). These foundations are followed by chapters that discuss case studies on smart cities, brain–computer interfaces, probabilistic mobile text entry, secure gestures, personal context from mobile phones, adaptive touch interfaces, and automotive user interfaces. The case studies chapters also highlight an in-depth look at the practical application of DSP and ML methods used for processing of touch, gesture, biometric, or embedded sensor inputs. A common theme throughout the case studies is ubiquitous support for humans in their daily professional or personal activities.In addition, the book provides walk-through examples of different DSP and ML techniques and their use in interactive systems. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal and multi-sensor systems. In a series of short additions to each chapter, an expert on the legal and ethical issues explores the emergent deep concerns of the professional community, on how DSP and ML should be adopted and used in socially appropriate ways, to most effectively advance human performance during ubiquitous interaction with omnipresent computers.This carefully edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the fields of DSP and ML. It provides a textbook for students and a reference and technology roadmap for developers and professionals working on interaction design on emerging platforms.}

The food price will be stored in a database of the web application in order to calculate the food price with the recognized food in the machine learning model. The outcome of this project is a customized web application for Village 3 Caf\'{e}, UTP with a trained CNN classification model at the backend.},

abstract = {Credit is an essential component of financial wellbeing in America, and unequal access to it is a large factor in the economic disparities between demographic groups that exist today. Today, machine learning algorithms, sometimes trained on alternative data, are increasingly being used to determine access to credit, yet research has shown that machine learning can encode many different versions of "unfairness," thus raising the concern that banks and other financial institutions could---potentially unwittingly---engage in illegal discrimination through the use of this technology. In the US, there are laws in place to make sure discrimination does not happen in lending and agencies charged with enforcing them. However, conversations around fair credit models in computer science and in policy are often misaligned: fair machine learning research often lacks legal and practical considerations specific to existing fair lending policy, and regulators have yet to issue new guidance on how, if at all, credit risk models should be utilizing practices and techniques from the research community. This paper aims to better align these sides of the conversation. We describe the current state of credit discrimination regulation in the United States, contextualize results from fair ML research to identify the specific fairness concerns raised by the use of machine learning in lending, and discuss regulatory opportunities to address these concerns.},

abstract = {Events are occurrences in specific locations, time, and semantics that nontrivially impact either our society or the nature, such as earthquakes, civil unrest, system failures, pandemics, and crimes. It is highly desirable to be able to anticipate the occurrence of such events in advance to reduce the potential social upheaval and damage caused. Event prediction, which has traditionally been prohibitively challenging, is now becoming a viable option in the big data era and is thus experiencing rapid growth, also thanks to advances in high performance computers and new Artificial Intelligence techniques. There is a large amount of existing work that focuses on addressing the challenges involved, including heterogeneous multi-faceted outputs, complex (e.g., spatial, temporal, and semantic) dependencies, and streaming data feeds. Due to the strong interdisciplinary nature of event prediction problems, most existing event prediction methods were initially designed to deal with specific application domains, though the techniques and evaluation procedures utilized are usually generalizable across different domains. However, it is imperative yet difficult to cross-reference the techniques across different domains, given the absence of a comprehensive literature survey for event prediction. This article aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive survey of the technologies, applications, and evaluations of event prediction in the big data era. First, systematic categorization and summary of existing techniques are presented, which facilitate domain experts’ searches for suitable techniques and help model developers consolidate their research at the frontiers. Then, comprehensive categorization and summary of major application domains are provided to introduce wider applications to model developers to help them expand the impacts of their research. Evaluation metrics and procedures are summarized and standardized to unify the understanding of model performance among stakeholders, model developers, and domain experts in various application domains. Finally, open problems and future directions are discussed.

LIGs facilitate causal strategic inference (CSI): Making inferences from causal interventions on stable behavior in strategic settings. Applications include the identification of the most in uential individuals in large (social) networks. Such tasks can also support policy-making analysis. Motivated by the computational work on LIGs, we cast the learning problem as maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) of a generative model defined by pure-strategy Nash equilibria (PSNE). Our simple formulation uncovers the fundamental interplay between goodness-of-fit and model complexity: good models capture equilibrium behavior within the data while controlling the true number of equilibria, including those unobserved. We provide a generalization bound establishing the sample complexity for MLE in our framework. We propose several algorithms including convex loss minimization (CLM) and sigmoidal approximations. We prove that the number of exact PSNE in LIGs is small, with high probability; thus, CLM is sound. We illustrate our approach on synthetic data and real-world U.S. congressional voting records. We briefly discuss our learning framework's generality and potential applicability to general graphical games.},

Contestability, making systems responsive to dispute, is a way to ensure they respect human rights to autonomy and dignity. We investigate the design of public urban AI systems for contestability through the example of camera cars: human-driven vehicles equipped with image sensors. Applying a provisional framework for contestable AI, we use speculative design to create a concept video of a contestable camera car. Using this concept video, we then conduct semi-structured interviews with 17 civil servants who work with AI employed by a large northwestern European city. The resulting data is analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis to identify the main challenges facing the implementation of contestability in public AI. We describe how civic participation faces issues of representation, public AI systems should integrate with existing democratic practices, and cities must expand capacities for responsible AI development and operation.},

abstract = {The field of fair machine learning aims to ensure that decisions guided by algorithms are equitable. Over the last decade, several formal, mathematical definitions of fairness have gained prominence. Here we first assemble and categorize these definitions into two broad families: (1) those that constrain the effects of decisions on disparities; and (2) those that constrain the effects of legally protected characteristics, like race and gender, on decisions. We then show, analytically and empirically, that both families of definitions typically result in strongly Pareto dominated decision policies. For example, in the case of college admissions, adhering to popular formal conceptions of fairness would simultaneously result in lower student-body diversity and a less academically prepared class, relative to what one could achieve by explicitly tailoring admissions policies to achieve desired outcomes. In this sense, requiring that these fairness definitions hold can, perversely, harm the very groups they were designed to protect. In contrast to axiomatic notions of fairness, we argue that the equitable design of algorithms requires grappling with their context-specific consequences, akin to the equitable design of policy. We conclude by listing several open challenges in fair machine learning and offering strategies to ensure algorithms are better aligned with policy goals.},

abstract = {We propose a new method for generating explanations with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a tool to test its expressive power within a user interface. In order to bridge the gap between philosophy and human-computer interfaces, we show a new approach for the generation of interactive explanations based on a sophisticated pipeline of AI algorithms for structuring natural language documents into knowledge graphs, answering questions effectively and satisfactorily. With this work, we aim to prove that the philosophical theory of explanations presented by Achinstein can be actually adapted for being implemented into a concrete software application, as an interactive and illocutionary process of answering questions. Specifically, our contribution is an approach to frame illocution in a computer-friendly way, to achieve user-centrality with statistical question answering. Indeed, we frame the illocution of an explanatory process as that mechanism responsible for anticipating the needs of the explainee in the form of unposed, implicit, archetypal questions, hence improving the user-centrality of the underlying explanatory process. Therefore, we hypothesise that if an explanatory process is an illocutionary act of providing content-giving answers to questions, and illocution is as we defined it, the more explicit and implicit questions can be answered by an explanatory tool, the more usable (as per ISO 9241-210) its explanations. We tested our hypothesis with a user-study involving more than 60 participants, on two XAI-based systems, one for credit approval (finance) and one for heart disease prediction (healthcare). The results showed that increasing the illocutionary power of an explanatory tool can produce statistically significant improvements (hence with a P value lower than .05) on effectiveness. This, combined with a visible alignment between the increments in effectiveness and satisfaction, suggests that our understanding of illocution can be correct, giving evidence in favour of our theory.},

abstract = {Social service providers play a vital role in the developmental outcomes of underprivileged youth as they transition into adulthood. Educators, mental health professionals, juvenile justice officers, and child welfare caseworkers often have first-hand knowledge of the trials uniquely faced by these vulnerable youth and are charged with mitigating harmful risks, such as mental health challenges, child abuse, drug use, and sex trafficking. Yet, less is known about whether or how social service providers assess and mitigate theonline risk experiences of youth under their care. Therefore, as part of the National Science Foundation (NSF) I-Corps program, we conducted interviews with 37 social service providers (SSPs) who work with underprivileged youth to determine what (if any) online risks are most concerning to them given their role in youth protection, how they assess or become aware of these online risk experiences, and whether they see value in the possibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential solution for online risk detection. Overall, online sexual risks (e.g., sexual grooming and abuse) and cyberbullying were the most salient concern across all social service domains, especially when these experiences crossed the boundary between the digital and the physical worlds. Yet, SSPs had to rely heavily on youth self-reports to know whether and when online risks occurred, which required building a trusting relationship with youth; otherwise, SSPs became aware only after a formal investigation had been launched. Therefore, most SSPs found value in the potential for using AI as an early detection system and to monitor youth, but they were concerned that such a solution would not be feasible due to a lack of resources to adequately respond to online incidences, access to the necessary digital trace data (e.g., social media), context, and concerns about violating the trust relationships they built with youth. Thus, such automated risk detection systems should be designed and deployed with caution, as their implementation could cause youth to mistrust adults, thereby limiting the receipt of necessary guidance and support. We add to the bodies of research on adolescent online safety and the benefits and challenges of leveraging algorithmic systems in the public sector.},

abstract = {In recent years, the process humans adopt to learn a foreign language has moved from the strict "Grammar –Translation" method, which is based mainly on grammar and syntax rules, to more innovative processes, resulting to the more modern "Communicative approach". As its name states, this approach focuses on the coherent communication with native speakers and the cultivation of oral skills, without taking into consideration, at least at the first stages, the rules that govern the language. The same trend seems to have been applied to the way machinery can be "educated" to comprehend and reproduce the unfamiliar, human language. The "rule based" Natural Language Generation (NLG) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) algorithms, on one hand, and the "text based" Large Language Models (LLMs), on the other, are two, analogous to the two human foreign language learning processes, subareas of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This paper presents these two alternative approaches, LLMs (a technology having surfaced as an influential catalyst of NLP, during last years) on the one hand and NLG/NLU on the other, highlighting their applications, their technologies, their capabilities, their differences, their strengths and weaknesses and the challenges they present, contributing to a deeper comprehension of the evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence and human-computer communication.},

abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications. For more experienced researchers and practitioners, the discussions in this book provide guidance for adopting a human-centered design and development approach to advance affective computing}

In addition, we have created a dataset on mobile phone usage, which we term as IITH-dataset on mobile phone usage (IITH-DMU). Although small, IITH-DMU is more generic than the KaggleDriver dataset, since it has images with higher amount of variation in foreground and background objects. Ours is possibly the first work to perform mobile-phone detection for a wide range of scenarios. On the KaggleDriver dataset, the AP at 0.5IoU is 98.97% with SSD and 98.84% with Faster-RCNN. On the IITH-DMU dataset, these numbers are 92.6% for SSD and 95.92% for Faster-RCNN. These pretrained models and the datasets are available at sites.google.com/view/mobile-phone-usage-detection},

If so, what are the behavioral factors that will help machine learning to discover the unknown relationship between gameplay and toxic behavior? In this initial study, we examine whether it is possible to predict toxicity in the MOBA gameFor Honor by observing in-game behavior for players that have been labeled as toxic (i.e. players that have been sanctioned by Ubisoft community managers). We test our hypothesis of detecting toxicity through gameplay with a dataset of almost 1,800 sanctioned players, and comparing these sanctioned players with unsanctioned players. Sanctioned players are defined by their toxic action type (offensive behavior vs. unfair advantage) and degree of severity (warned vs. banned). Our findings, based on supervised learning with random forests, suggest that it is not only possible to behaviorally distinguish sanctioned from unsanctioned players based on selected features of gameplay; it is also possible to predict both the sanction severity (warned vs. banned) and the sanction type (offensive behavior vs. unfair advantage). In particular, all random forest models predict toxicity, its severity, and type, with an accuracy of at least 82%, on average, on unseen players. This research shows that observing in-game behavior can support the work of community managers in moderating and possibly containing the burden of toxic behavior.},

abstract = {The advent of recent Natural Language Processing technology has led human and machine interactions more toward conversation. In Conversational Search Systems (CSS) like chatbots and Virtual Personal Assistants such as Apple’s Siri, Amazon Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Google Assistant, both user and device have a limited platform to communicate through chatting or voice. In the information-seeking process, often users do not know how to properly describe their information need in a machine understandable language. Consequently, it is hard for the assistant agent to predict the user’s intent and yield relevant results by only relying on the original query. Studies have shown many unsatisfactory results can be enhanced with the benefit of CSS, which can dig deeper into the user’s query to reveal the real need. This survey intends to provide a comprehensive and comparative overview of ambiguous query clarification task in the context of conversational search technology. We investigate different approaches, their evaluation methods, and future work. We also address the importance of understanding a query for retrieving the most relevant document(s) and satisfying user’s need by predicting their potential request. This work provides an overview of characteristics of ambiguous queries and contributes to better understanding of the existing technologies and challenges in CSS focus on disambiguation of unclear queries from various dimensions.},

abstract = {Mobile phones provide a powerful sensing platform that researchers may adopt to understand proximity interactions among people and the diffusion, through these interactions, of diseases, behaviors, and opinions. However, it remains a challenge to track the proximity-based interactions of a whole community and then model the social diffusion of diseases and behaviors starting from the observations of a small fraction of the volunteer population. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that tries to connect together these sparse observations using a model of how individuals interact with each other and how social interactions happen in terms of a sequence of proximity interactions. We apply our approach to track the spreading of flu in the spatial-proximity network of a 3000-people university campus by mobilizing 300 volunteers from this population to monitor nearby mobile phones through Bluetooth scanning and to daily report flu symptoms about and around them. Our aim is to predict the likelihood for an individual to get flu based on how often her/his daily routine intersects with those of the volunteers. Thus, we use the daily routines of the volunteers to build a model of the volunteers as well as of the non-volunteers. Our results show that we can predict flu infection two weeks ahead of time with an average precision from 0.24 to 0.35 depending on the amount of information. This precision is six to nine times higher than with a random guess model. At the population level, we can predict infectious population in a two-week window with an r-squared value of 0.95 (a random-guess model obtains an r-squared value of 0.2). These results point to an innovative approach for tracking individuals who have interacted with people showing symptoms, allowing us to warn those in danger of infection and to inform health researchers about the progression of contact-induced diseases.},

abstract = {Human participants play a central role in the development of modern artificial intelligence (AI) technology, in psychological science, and in user research. Recent advances in generative AI have attracted growing interest to the possibility of replacing human participants in these domains with AI surrogates. We survey several such “substitution proposals” to better understand the arguments for and against substituting human participants with modern generative AI. Our scoping review indicates that the recent wave of these proposals is motivated by goals such as reducing the costs of research and development work and increasing the diversity of collected data. However, these proposals ignore and ultimately conflict with foundational values of work with human participants: representation, inclusion, and understanding. This paper critically examines the principles and goals underlying human participation to help chart out paths for future work that truly centers and empowers participants.},

Many tools are currently in deployment, offering potential benefits, including improved efficiency and consistency. However, there are also important concerns. Transparent information about these tools, their purpose, how they are used, and by whom is difficult to obtain. Even when information is available, it is often insufficient to enable a satisfactory evaluation. More work is needed to establish governance mechanisms to ensure that tools are deployed in a transparent, safe and ethical way. We call for more engagement with stakeholders and greater documentation of the intended goal of a tool, how it will achieve this goal compared to other options, and how it will be monitored in deployment. We highlight additional points to consider when evaluating the trustworthiness of deployed tools and make concrete proposals for policy.},

We find experimentally that the answer is affirmative when we have access to the training data for the model, and guardedly affirmative even if we do not.This suggests that the auto-regressive models can be improved by incorporating the (globally normalized) discriminators into the generative process. We give a formalism for this using the Energy-Based Model framework, and show that it indeed improves the results of the generative models, measured both in terms of perplexity and in terms of human evaluation.},

In this work, we release yet another sports video benchmark P2ANet for Ping Pong-Action detection, which consists of 2,721 video clips collected from the broadcasting videos of professional table tennis matches in World Table&nbsp;Tennis Championships and Olympiads. We work with a crew of table tennis professionals and referees on a specially designed annotation toolbox to obtain fine-grained action labels (in 14 classes) for every ping-pong action that appeared in the dataset, and formulate two sets of action detection problems—action localization and action recognition. We evaluate a number of commonly seen action recognition (e.g., TSM, TSN, Video SwinTransformer, and Slowfast) and action localization models (e.g., BSN, BSN++, BMN, TCANet), using P2ANet for both problems, under various settings. These models can only achieve 48% area under the AR-AN curve for localization and 82% top-one accuracy for recognition since the ping-pong actions are dense with fast-moving subjects but broadcasting videos are with only 25 FPS. The results confirm that P2ANet is still a challenging task and can be used as a special benchmark for dense action detection from videos.

abstract = {The legal judgment prediction (LJP) task is to automatically decide appropriate law articles, charges, and term of penalty for giving the fact description of a law case. It considerably influences many real legal applications and has thus attracted the attention of legal practitioners and AI researchers in recent years. In real scenarios, many confusing charges are encountered, which makes LJP challenging. Intuitively, for a controversial legal case, legal practitioners usually first obtain various possible judgment results as candidates based on the fact description of the case; then these candidates generally need to be carefully considered based on the facts and the rationality of the candidates. Inspired by this observation, this paper presents a novel &lt;bold&gt;R&lt;/bold&gt;ecall &amp; &lt;bold&gt;R&lt;/bold&gt;anking framework, dubbed as &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$boldsymbol{R}^{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;, which attempts to formalize LJP as a two-stage problem. The recall stage is designed to collect high-likelihood judgment results for a given case; these results are regarded as candidates for the ranking stage. The ranking stage introduces a verification technique to learn the relationships between the fact description and the candidates. It treats the partially correct candidates as semi-negative samples, and thus has a certain ability to distinguish confusing candidates. Moreover, we devise a comprehensive judgment strategy to refine the final judgment results by comprehensively considering the rationality of multiple probable candidates. We carry out numerous experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate our proposed approach's effectiveness compared to the other competitive baselines.},

abstract = {The prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and increasing cyber-attacks, especially Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), require automating the forensics investigation process in the IoT networks. The effectiveness of existing digital forensic techniques and tools, when tasked with finding attack traces and their origins in IoT environments suffers due to the inherent volatility and heterogeneity of the IoT. To address these issues, we aim at developing a deep federated learning-based digital forensic method, which identifies cyber-attacks and examines their attributes in IoT networks. The proposed method is designed based on Federated Learning (FL) to preserve data privacy to learn multi-stage attack events and define their traces. Our method uses FL rounds to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model locally on IoT network data and share only the learned hyperparameters with the federated server instead of sharing the evidence data. The method is evaluated using the ToN-IoT dataset and compared with other two peer machine-learning models and a non-FL technique that uses the same Deep Learning (DL) model and settings. The results showed that the proposed method outperforms the other ones in discovering attacks by achieving 81.69% detection accuracy in less training time than the non-FL method when dropping the network flow identifiers features besides guaranteeing data privacy. The Proposed method would be deployed at the identification, examination and analysis phases of digital forensics to automate its process and offer forensically sound evidence that could be used in a court of law.},

Though there are rising concerns about privacy and ethical implications, users of these IPAs seem to continue using these systems. We aim to investigate to what extent users are concerned about privacy and how they are handling these concerns while using the IPAs. By utilizing the reviews posted online along with the responses to a survey, this paper provides a set of insights about the detected markers related to user interests and privacy challenges. The insights suggest that users of these systems irrespective of their concerns about privacy, are generally positive in terms of utilizing IPAs in their everyday lives. However, there is a significant percentage of users who are concerned about privacy and take further actions to address related concerns. Some percentage of users expressed that they do not have any privacy concerns but when they learned about the "always listening" feature of these devices, their concern about privacy increased.},

In this paper, through the prediction performance of various high-order data, the composition and proportion of the model are constantly changed. Finally, a rule algorithm generated by the trained neural network is obtained. Then, the BP neural network model is trained (including the 18-19 season that has not yet ended) by using the historical data of the NBA in the past ten years. Then, the established model is mainly used in the 18-19 season (at the time of publication). The results are still unknown) NBA regular season MVP prediction.

abstract = {We explore the promises and challenges of employing sequential decision-making algorithms -- such as bandits, reinforcement learning, and active learning -- in law and public policy. While such algorithms have well-characterized performance in the private sector (e.g., online advertising), the tendency to naively apply algorithms motivated by one domain, often online advertisements, can be called the ''advertisement fallacy.'' Our main thesis is that law and public policy pose distinct methodological challenges that the machine learning community has not yet addressed. Machine learning will need to address these methodological problems to move ''beyond ads.'' Public law, for instance, can pose multiple objectives, necessitate batched and delayed feedback, and require systems to learn rational, causal decision-making policies, each of which presents novel questions at the research frontier. We discuss a wide range of potential applications of sequential decision-making algorithms in regulation and governance, including public health, environmental protection, tax administration, occupational safety, and benefits adjudication. We use these examples to highlight research needed to render sequential decision making policy-compliant, adaptable, and effective in the public sector. We also note the potential risks of such deployments and describe how sequential decision systems can also facilitate the discovery of harms. We hope our work inspires more investigation of sequential decision making in law and public policy, which provide unique challenges for machine learning researchers with potential for significant social benefit.},

abstract = {Scenario Analytics is a type of analysis that focuses on the evaluation of different scenarios, their merits and their consequences. In the context of the legal domain, this could be in the form of analyzing large databases of legal cases, their facts and their claims, to answer questions such as: Do the current facts warrant litigation?, Is the litigation best pursued before a judge or a jury?, How long is it likely to take?, and What are the best strategies to use for achieving the most favorable outcome for the client? In this work, we report on research directed at answering such questions. We use one of a set of jury verdicts databases totaling nearly a half-million records. At the same time, we conduct a series of experiments that answer key questions and build, sequentially, a powerful data-driven legal decision support system, one that can assist an attorney to differentiate more effective from less effective legal principles and strategies. Ultimately, it represents a productivity tool that can help a litigation attorney make the most prudent decisions for his or her client.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the design and evaluation of a coaching system used to train young politicians to apply appropriate multimodal rhetoric devices to improve their debate skills. The presented study is carried out to develop debate performance assessment methods and interaction models underlying a Virtual Debate Coach (VDC) application. We identify a number of criteria associated with three questions: (1) how convincing is a debater's argumentation; (2) how well are debate arguments structured; and (3) how well is an argument delivered. We collected and analysed multimodal data of trainees' debate behaviour, and contrasted it with that of skilled professional debaters. Observational, correlation and machine learning experiments were performed to identify multimodal correlates of convincing debate performance and link them to experts' assessments. A rich set of prosodic, motion, linguistic and structural features was considered for the system to operate on. The VDC system was positively evaluated in a trainee-based setting.},

Indeed, European law provides individuals limited rights to 'meaningful information about the logic' behind significant, autonomous decisions such as loan approvals, insurance quotes, and CV filtering. We undertake three experimental studies examining people's perceptions of justice in algorithmic decision-making under different scenarios and explanation styles. Dimensions of justice previously observed in response to human decision-making appear similarly engaged in response to algorithmic decisions. Qualitative analysis identified several concerns and heuristics involved in justice perceptions including arbitrariness, generalisation, and (in)dignity. Quantitative analysis indicates that explanation styles primarily matter to justice perceptions only when subjects are exposed to multiple different styles---under repeated exposure of one style, scenario effects obscure any explanation effects. Our results suggests there may be no 'best' approach to explaining algorithmic decisions, and that reflection on their automated nature both implicates and mitigates justice dimensions.},

abstract = {This essay joins recent scholarship in arguing that FAccT's fundamental framing of the potential to achieve the normative conditions for justice through bettering the design of algorithmic systems is counterproductive to achieving said justice in practice. Insofar as the FAccT community's research tends to prioritize design-stage interventions, it ignores the fact that the majority of the contextual factors that practically determine FAccT outcomes happen in the implementation and impact stages of AI/ML lifecycles.We analyze an emergent and widely-cited movement within the FAccT community for attempting to honor the centrality of contextual factors in shaping social outcomes, a set of strategies we term ‘metadata maximalism’. Symptomatic of design-centered approaches, metadata maximalism abstracts away its reliance on institutions and structures of justice that are, by every observable metric, already struggling (where not failing) to provide accessible, enforceable rights. These justice infrastructures, moreover, are currently wildly under-equipped to manage the disputes arising from digital transformation and machine learning. The political economy of AI/ML implementation provides further obstructions to realizing rights. Data and software supply chains, in tandem with intellectual property protections, introduce structural sources of opacity. Where duties of care to vulnerable persons should reign, profit incentives are given legal and regulatory primacy. Errors are inevitable and inextricable from the development of machine learning systems.In the face of these realities, FAccT programs, including metadata maximalism, tend to project their efforts in a fundamentally counter-factual universe: one in which functioning institutions and processes for due diligence in implementation and for redress of harms are working and ready to interoperate with. Unfortunately, in our world, these institutions and processes have been captured by the interests they are meant to hold accountable, intentionally hollowed-out, and/or were never designed to function in today's sociotechnical landscape. Continuing to produce (fair! accountable! transparent!) data-enabled systems that operate in high-impact areas, irrespective of this landscape's radically insufficient paths to justice, given the unavoidability of errors and/or intentional misuse in implementation, and the exhaustively-demonstrated disproportionate distribution of resulting harms onto already-marginalized communities, is a choice - a choice to be CounterFAccTual.},

abstract = {This work presents an end-to-end trainable deep bidirectional LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) model for image captioning. Our model builds on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and two separate LSTM networks. It is capable of learning long term visual-language interactions by making use of history and future context information at high level semantic space. Two novel deep bidirectional variant models, in which we increase the depth of nonlinearity transition in different way, are proposed to learn hierarchical visual-language embeddings. Data augmentation techniques such as multi-crop, multi-scale and vertical mirror are proposed to prevent overfitting in training deep models. We visualize the evolution of bidirectional LSTM internal states over time and qualitatively analyze how our models "translate" image to sentence. Our proposed models are evaluated on caption generation and image-sentence retrieval tasks with three benchmark datasets: Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets. We demonstrate that bidirectional LSTM models achieve highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art results on caption generation even without integrating additional mechanism (e.g. object detection, attention model etc.) and significantly outperform recent methods on retrieval task},

address = {USA},
abstract = {The stability and performance of Cloud platforms are essential as they directly impact customers' satisfaction. Cloud service providers use Cloud monitoring tools to ensure that rendered services match the quality of service requirements indicated in established contracts such as service-level agreements.Given the enormous number of resources that need to be monitored, highly scalable and capable monitoring tools are designed and implemented by Cloud service providers such as Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. Cloud monitoring tools monitor millions of virtual and physical resources and continuously generate logs for each one of them. Considering that logs magnify any technical issue, they can be used for disaster detection, prevention, and recovery. However, logs are useless if they are not assessed and analyzed promptly. Thus, we argue that the scale of Cloud-generated logs makes it impossible for DevOps teams to analyze them effectively. This implies that one needs to automate the process of monitoring and analysis (e.g., using machine learning and artificial intelligence). If the automation will witness an anomaly in the logs --- it will alert DevOps staff.The automatic anomaly detectors require a reliable and scalable platform for gathering, filtering, and transforming the logs, executing the detector models, and sending out the alerts to the DevOps staff. In this work, we report on implementing a prototype of such a platform based on the 7-layered architecture pattern, which leverages micro-service principles to distribute tasks among highly scalable, resources-efficient modules. The modules interact with each other via an instance of the Publish-Subscribe architectural pattern. The platform is deployed on the IBM Cloud service infrastructure and is used to detect anomalies in logs emitted by the IBM Cloud services, hence the dogfooding. In particular, we leverage IBM Cloud Functions to deploy the computing modules, IBM Event Streams to establish communication among the modules, and IBM Cloud Object Storage and IBM Cloudant for persistent storage.The prototype efficiency is promising: it takes the platform 17 seconds or less from the point of receiving a new log record to emitting an alert to the IBM Cloud DevOps team.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have become the dominant means of curating cultural content, significantly influencing the nature of individual cultural experience. While the majority of academic and industrial research on recommender systems optimizes for personalized user experience, this paradigm does not capture the ways that recommender systems impact cultural experience in the aggregate, across populations of users. Although existing novelty, diversity, and fairness studies probe how recommender systems relate to the broader social role of cultural content, they do not adequately center culture as a core concept and challenge. In this work, we introduce commonality as a new measure of recommender systems that reflects the degree to which recommendations familiarize a given user population with specified categories of cultural content. Our proposed commonality metric responds to a set of arguments developed through an interdisciplinary dialogue between researchers in computer science and the social sciences and humanities. With reference to principles underpinning public service media (PSM) systems in democratic societies, we identify universality of address and content diversity in the service of strengthening cultural citizenship as particularly relevant goals for recommender systems delivering cultural content. We develop commonality as a measure of recommender system alignment with the promotion of a shared cultural experience of, and exposure to, diverse cultural content across a population of users. Moreover, we advocate for the involvement of human editors accountable to a larger value community as a fundamental part of defining categories in the service of cultural citizenship. We empirically compare the performance of recommendation algorithms using commonality with existing utility, diversity, novelty, and fairness metrics using three different domains. Our results demonstrate that commonality captures a property of system behavior complementary to existing metrics and suggests the need for alternative, non-personalized interventions in recommender systems oriented to strengthening cultural citizenship across populations of users. Moreover, commonality demonstrates both consistent results under different editorial policies and robustness to missing labels and users. Alongside existing fairness and diversity metrics, commonality contributes to a growing body of scholarship developing “public good” rationales for digital media and machine learning systems.},

abstract = {With social media becoming the most frequently used mode of modern-day communications, the propagation of fake or vicious news through such modes of communication has emerged as a serious problem. The scope of the problem of fake or vicious news may range from rumour-mongering, with intent to defame someone, to manufacturing false opinions/trends impacting elections and stock exchanges to much more alarming and mala fide repercussions of inciting violence by bad actors, especially in sensitive law-and-order situations. Therefore, curbing fake or vicious news and identifying the source of such news to ensure strict accountability is the need of the hour. Researchers have been working in the area of using text analysis, labelling, artificial intelligence, and machine learning techniques for detecting fake news, but identifying the source or originator of such news for accountability is still a big challenge for which no concrete approach exists as of today. Also, there is another common problematic trend on social media whereby targeted vicious content goes viral to mobilize or instigate people with malicious intent to destabilize normalcy in society. In the proposed solution, we treat both problems of fake news and vicious news together. We propose a blockchain and keyed watermarking-based framework for social media/messaging platforms that will allow the integrity of the posted content as well as ensure accountability on the owner/user of the post. Intrinsic properties of blockchain-like transparency and immutability are advantageous for curbing fake or vicious news. After identification of fake or vicious news, its spread will be immediately curbed through backtracking as well as forward tracking. Also, observing transactions on the blockchain, the density and rate of forwarding of a particular original message going beyond a threshold can easily be checked, which could be identified as a possible malicious attempt to spread objectionable content. If the content is deemed dangerous or inappropriate, its spread will be curbed immediately. The use of the Raft consensus algorithm and bloXroute servers is proposed to enhance throughput and network scalability, respectively. Thus, the framework offers a proactive as well as reactive, practically feasible, and effective solution for curtailment of fake or vicious news on social media/messaging platforms. The proposed work is a framework for solving fake or vicious news spread problems on social media; the complete design specifications are beyond scope of the current work and will be addressed in the future.},

While some prior work has explored impacted stakeholders’ concerns with current uses of data-driven predictive risk models (PRMs), less work has asked stakeholders whether such tools ought to be used in the first place. In this work, we conducted a set of seven design workshops with 35 stakeholders who have been impacted by the child welfare system or who work in it to understand their beliefs and concerns around PRMs, and to engage them in imagining new uses of data and technologies in the child welfare system. We found that participants worried current PRMs perpetuate or exacerbate existing problems in child welfare. Participants suggested new ways to use data and data-driven tools to better support impacted communities and suggested paths to mitigate possible harms of these tools. Participants also suggested low-tech or no-tech alternatives to PRMs to address problems in child welfare. Our study sheds light on how researchers and designers can work in solidarity with impacted communities, possibly to circumvent or oppose child welfare agencies.},

AI’s entry into complex socio-techno-legal systems raises issues of transparency, specifically for regulators. However, the perspective of supervisors, regulators who monitor compliance with applicable financial regulations, has rarely been studied. This paper focuses on understanding the needs of supervisors in anti-money laundering (AML) to better inform the design of AI justifications and explanations in highly regulated fields. Through scenario-based workshops with 13 supervisors and 6 banking professionals, we outline the auditing practices and socio-technical context of the supervisor. By combining the workshops’ insights with an analysis of compliance requirements, we identify the AML obligations that conflict with AI opacity. We then formulate seven needs that supervisors have for model justifiability. We discuss the role of explanations as reliable evidence on which to base justifications.},

abstract = {Although the celebrated Vickrey auction is strategy-proof and guaranteed to achieve an efficient allocation in a single-object auction, if there exists no outside party (i.e., a seller or an auctioneer) with the right to collect the payment, the collected payment will be wasted. Redistribution mechanisms try to redistribute the payment to participating agents as much as possible without violating strategy-proofness. However, when a losing agent can obtain part of the payment, she may have an incentive to participate under multiple identities and receive a greater share of the redistribution.Our goal is to develop false-name-proof redistribution mechanisms that are robust against such manipulations. First, we prove that no mechanism simultaneously satisfies false-name-proofness and allocative efficiency, except for the Vickrey auction. Next, we propose a class of false-name-proof redistribution mechanisms, which are characterized by several parameters. We show that each mechanism in the class is not dominated by any other false-name-proof mechanism in terms of social welfare. Precisely, by choosing these parameters appropriately, all instances of this class are guaranteed to achieve at least the same amount of social welfare obtained by any false-name-proof mechanism. Furthermore, we formalize an optimization problem that determines appropriate parameter values based on prior information about participating agents.},

While the interfaces may look appealing and the apparent breadth of applicability is exciting, we are concerned that the field is rushing ahead with a technology without sufficient study of the uses it is meant to serve, how it would be used, and what its use would mean. We argue that it is important to reassert the central research focus of the field of information retrieval, because information access is not merely an application to be solved by the so-called ‘AI’ techniques du jour. Rather, it is a key human activity, with impacts on both individuals and society. As information scientists, we should be asking what do people and society want and need from information access systems and how do we design and build systems to meet those needs? With that goal, in this conceptual article we investigate fundamental questions concerning information access from user and societal viewpoints. We revisit foundational work related to information behavior, information seeking, information retrieval, information filtering, and information access to resurface what we know about these fundamental questions and what may be missing. We then provide our conceptual framing about how we could fill this gap, focusing on methods as well as experimental and evaluation frameworks. We consider the Web as an information ecosystem and explore the ways in which synthetic media, produced by LLMs and otherwise, endangers that ecosystem. The primary goal of this conceptual article is to shed light on what we still do not know about the potential impacts of LLM-based information access systems, how to advance our understanding of user behaviors, and where the next generations of students, scholars, and developers could fruitfully invest their energies.},

abstract = {How to protect people from algorithmic harms? A promising solution, although in its infancy, is algorithmic impact assessment (AIA). AIAs are iterative processes used to investigate the possible short and long terms societal impacts of AI systems before their use, but with ongoing monitoring and periodic revisiting even after their implementation. When conducted in a participatory and transparent fashion, they could create bridges across the legal, social and computer science domains, promoting the accountability of the entity performing them as well as public scrutiny. They could enable to re-attach the societal and regulatory context to the mathematical definition of fairness, thus expanding the formalistic approach thereto. Whilst the regulatory framework in the European Union currently lacks the obligation to perform such AIA, some other provisions are expected to play a role in AI development, leading the way towards more widespread adoption of AIA. These include the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the risk assessment process under the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Conformity Assessment (CA) foreseen under the AI Regulation proposal.In this paper, after briefly introducing the plurality of definitions of fairness in the legal, social and computer science domains, and explaining to which extent the current and upcoming legal framework mandates the adoption of fairness metrics, we will illustrate how AIA could create bridges between all these disciplines, allowing us to build fairer AI solutions. We will then recognise the role of DPIA, DSA risk assessment and CA by discussing the contributions they can offer towards AIA but also identify the aspects lacking therein. We will then identify how these assessment provisions could aid the overall technical discussion of introducing and assessing fairness in AI-based models and processes.},

abstract = {Transformer-based contextualized language models constitute the state-of-the-art in several natural language processing (NLP) tasks and applications. Despite their utility, contextualized models can contain human-like social biases, as their training corpora generally consist of human-generated text. Evaluating and removing social biases in NLP models has been a major research endeavor. In parallel, NLP approaches in the legal domain, namely, legal NLP or computational law, have also been increasing. Eliminating unwanted bias in legal NLP is crucial, since the law has the utmost importance and effect on people. In this work, we focus on the gender bias encoded in BERT-based models. We propose a new template-based bias measurement method with a new bias evaluation corpus using crime words from the FBI database. This method quantifies the gender bias present in BERT-based models for legal applications. Furthermore, we propose a new fine-tuning-based debiasing method using the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) corpus to debias legal pre-trained models. We test the debiased models’ language understanding performance on the LexGLUE benchmark to confirm that the underlying semantic vector space is not perturbed during the debiasing process. Finally, we propose a bias penalty for the performance scores to emphasize the effect of gender bias on model performance.},

Knowledge capture involves the extraction of useful knowledge from vast and diverse data sources as well as its acquisition directly from human experts.Nowadays knowledge is derived from an increasingly diverse set of data resources that differ with regard to their domain, format, quality, coverage, specificity, viewpoint, bias, and most importantly, consumers and producers of data. The heterogeneity, amount and complexity of data allow us to answer complex questions that could not be answered in isolation, requiring the interaction of different scientific fields and technologies. A goal of K-CAP is to develop such synergies using systematic and rigorous methodologies.The call for papers attracted 105 submissions from all over the world, covering a diverse range of topics spanning knowledge mining, large language models for information extraction, neuro-symbolic approaches for knowledge capture, knowledge engineering, question-answering, knowledge graphs, natural language processing, reasoning, entity linking, querying and knowledge-based applications. From a competitive set of high-quality submissions, we accepted 27 long research papers, 5 short papers, and 1 vision paper. The high-quality program is divided into 7 research sessions, in addition to 3 tutorials reflecting novel topics of interest in Knowledge Capture.We encourage everyone to attend the keynote talks that we have planned for K-CAP 2023. The highly anticipated talks by Dr. Robert R. Hoffman (Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition) and Dr. Jane Pinelis (Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory) will guide us to a better understanding of the future of knowledge capture and explainable, resilient AI ecosystems, as they become commonplace in real world applications.},

abstract = {Much of political debate focuses on the concern that machines might take over. Yet in many domains it is much more plausible that the ultimate choice and responsibility remain with a human decision-maker, but that she is provided with machine advice. A quintessential illustration is the decision of a judge to bail or jail a defendant. In multiple jurisdictions in the US, judges have access to a machine prediction about a defendant's recidivism risk. In our study, we explore how receiving machine advice influences people's bail decisions. We run a vignette experiment with laypersons whom we test on a subsample of cases from the database of this prediction tool. In study 1, we ask them to predict whether defendants will recidivate before tried, and manipulate whether they have access to machine advice. We find that receiving machine advice has a small effect, which is biased in the direction of predicting no recidivism. In the field, human decision makers sometimes have a chance, after the fact, to learn whether the machine has given good advice. In study 2, after each trial we inform participants of ground truth. This does not make it more likely that they follow the advice, despite the fact that the machine is (on average) slightly more accurate than real judges. This also holds if initially the advice is mostly correct, or if it initially is mostly to predict (no) recidivism. Real judges know that their decisions affect defendants' lives. They may also be concerned about reelection or promotion. Hence a lot is at stake. In study 3 we emulate high stakes by giving participants a financial incentive. An incentive to find the ground truth, or to avoid false positive or false negatives, does not make participants more sensitive to machine advice. But an incentive to follow the advice is effective.},

abstract = {Confidence in the regulatory environment is crucial to enable responsible AI innovation and foster the social acceptance of these powerful new technologies. One notable source of uncertainty is, however, that the existing legal liability system is unable to assign responsibility where a potentially harmful conduct and/or the harm itself are unforeseeable, yet some instantiations of AI and/or the harms they may trigger are not foreseeable in the legal sense. The unpredictability of how courts would handle such cases makes the risks involved in the investment and use of AI difficult to calculate with confidence, creating an environment that is not conducive to innovation and may deprive society of some benefits AI could provide. To tackle this problem, we propose to draw insights from financial regulatory best practices and establish a system of AI guarantee schemes. We envisage the system to form part of the broader market-structuring regulatory frameworks, with the primary function to provide a readily available, clear, and transparent funding mechanism to compensate claims that are either extremely hard or impossible to realize via conventional litigation. We propose it to be at least partially industry-funded. Funding arrangements should depend on whether it would pursue other potential policy goals aimed more broadly at controlling the trajectory of AI innovation to increase economic and social welfare worldwide. Because of the global relevance of the issue, rather than focusing on any particular legal system, we trace relevant developments across multiple jurisdictions and engage in a high-level, comparative conceptual debate around the suitability of the foreseeability concept to limit legal liability. The paper also refrains from confronting the intricacies of the case law of specific jurisdictions for now and—recognizing the importance of this task—leaves this to further research in support of the legal system’s incremental adaptation to the novel challenges of present and future AI technologies.

abstract = {Whether bias is an appropriate lens for analysis and critique remains a subject of debate among scholars. This paper contributes to this conversation by unpacking the use of bias in a critical analysis of a controversial austerity algorithm introduced by the Austrian public employment service in 2018. It was envisioned to classify the unemployed into three risk categories based on predicted prospects for re-employment. The system promised to increase efficiency and effectivity of counseling while objectifying a new austerity support measure allocation scheme. This approach was intended to cut spending for those deemed at highest risk of long term unemployment. Our in-depth analysis, based on internal documentation not available to the public, systematically traces and categorizes various problematic biases to illustrate harms to job seekers and challenge promises used to justify the adoption of the system. The classification is guided by a long-established bias framework for computer systems developed by Friedman and Nissenbaum, which provides three sensitizing basic categories. We identified in our analysis "technical biases," like issues around measurement, rigidity, and coarseness of variables, "emergent biases," such as disruptive events that change the labor market, and, finally, "preexisting biases," like the use of variables that act as proxies for inequality. Grounded in our case study, we argue that articulated biases can be strategically used as boundary objects to enable different actors to critically debate and challenge problematic systems without prior consensus building. We unpack benefits and risks of using bias classification frameworks to guide analysis. They have recently received increased scholarly attention and thereby may influence the identification and construction of biases. By comparing four bias frameworks and drawing on our case study, we illustrate how they are political by prioritizing certain aspects in analysis while disregarding others. Furthermore, we discuss how they vary in their granularity and how this can influence analysis. We also problematize how these frameworks tend to favor explanations for bias that center the algorithm instead of social structures. We discuss several recommendations to make bias analyses more emancipatory, arguing that biases should be seen as starting points for reflection on harmful impacts, questioning the framing imposed by the imagined “unbiased" center that the bias is supposed to distort, and seeking out deeper explanations and histories that also center bigger social structures, power dynamics, and marginalized perspectives. Finally, we reflect on the risk that these frameworks may stabilize problematic notions of bias, for example, when they become a standard or enshrined in law.},

AI-mediated social interaction is the AI-facilitated process of building and maintaining social connections between individuals through information inferred from people's online posts. With its impending application across a number of contexts, the challenges and opportunities of AI-mediated social interaction remain underexplored. This paper seeks to understand the design space of AI-mediated social interaction in the context of online learning, where students frequently face social isolation. We deployed an AI agent named SAMI in three class discussion forums to help online learners build social connections. Using SAMI as a probe, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 students to understand their difficulties in remote social interactions and their experiences with SAMI. Through the lenses of social translucence and social-technical gap, we illustrate online learners' difficulties in remote social interactions and how SAMI resolved some of the difficulties. We also identify potential ethical and social challenges of SAMI such as user agency and privacy. Based on our findings, we outline the design space of AI-mediated social interaction. We discuss the design tension between AI performance and ethical design and pinpoint two design opportunities for AI-mediated social interaction in designing towards human-AI collaborative social matching and artificial serendipity.},

abstract = {The explosive growth of social media has fueled an extensive increase in online freedom of speech. The worldwide platform of human voice creates possibilities to assail other users without facing any consequences, and flout social etiquettes, resulting in an inevitable increase of hate speech. Nowadays, English hate speech detection is a popular research area, but the prevalence of implicit hate content in regional languages desire effective language-independent models. The proposed research is the first unsupervised Hindi and Bengali hate content detection framework consisting of three significant concepts: HateCircle, hate tweet classification, and code-switch data preparation algorithms. The novel HateCircle method is proposed to detect hate orientation for each term by co-occurrence patterns of words, contextual semantics, and emotion analysis. The efficient multiclass hate tweet classification algorithm is proposed with parts of speech tagging, Euclidean distance, and the Geometric median methods. The detection of hate content is more efficient in the native script compared to the Roman script, so the transliteration algorithm is also proposed for code-switch data preparation. The experimentation evaluates the combination of various lexicons with our enriched hate lexicon that achieves a maximum of 0.74 F1-score for the Hindi and 0.88 F1-score for the Bengali datasets. The novel HateCircle and hate tweet detection framework evaluates with our proposed parts of speech tagging and Geometric median detection methods. Results reveal that HateCircle and hate tweet detection framework also achieves a maximum of 0.73 accuracy for the Hindi and 0.78 accuracy for the Bengali dataset. The experiment results signify that contextual semantic hate speech detection research with a language-independency feature offsets the growth of implicit abusive text in social media.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is already changing the way law is being applied, thereby fundamentally affecting the very core of society. While there is increasing interest in the possibility to create machines that automatically process, adapt, and enforce regulation, cross-disciplinary research between AI and law has not yet determined to what extent such legally intelligent machines can and should be built. This article addresses this gap by providing the first attempt to quantify the automatic encodability of regulations. To do so, we propose an algorithm that first gauges sentence complexity for machines by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques for sentence simplification for open relations extraction systems; in addition, the algorithm assesses word complexity for machines by attempting to link terms to supposed functional requirements, a task that involves finding matching concepts in public ontologies and controlled vocabularies. We apply our methodology to several legislations---a few of which have already been manually transformed into machine-processable form successfully, and others for which the assumption is that they are less encodable due to the many open-textured terms that they contain. This analysis demonstrates coherence with our expectations that those deemed as featuring high ambiguity are less prone to be automatically turned into automatically processable regulation. This research is highly relevant as it provides directions to the AI as well as the legal community, and to interdisciplinary teams, with respect to enabling a nuanced discussion needed within the field on the normative challenges that the automatic processing, adaptation, and enforcement of regulation is already creating, and will trigger in the future.},

abstract = {Sports competitions are widely researched in computer and social science, with
                    the goal of understanding how players act under uncertainty. Although there is
                    an abundance of computational work on player metrics prediction based on past
                    performance, very few attempts to incorporate out-of-game signals have been
                    made. Specifically, it was previously unclear whether linguistic signals
                    gathered from players’ interviews can add information that does not
                    appear in performance metrics. To bridge that gap, we define text classification
                    tasks of predicting deviations from mean in NBA players’ in-game actions,
                    which are associated with strategic choices, player behavior, and risk, using
                    their choice of language prior to the game. We collected a data set of
                    transcripts from key NBA players’ pre-game interviews and their in-game
                    performance metrics, totalling 5,226 interview-metric pairs. We design neural
                    models for players’ action prediction based on increasingly more complex
                    aspects of the language signals in their open-ended interviews. Our models can
                    make their predictions based on the textual signal alone, or on a combination of
                    that signal with signals from past-performance metrics. Our text-based models
                    outperform strong baselines trained on performance metrics only, demonstrating
                    the importance of language usage for action prediction. Moreover, the models
                    that utilize both textual input and past-performance metrics produced the best
                    results. Finally, as neural networks are notoriously difficult to interpret, we
                    propose a method for gaining further insight into what our models have learned.
                    Particularly, we present a latent Dirichlet allocation–based analysis,
                    where we interpret model predictions in terms of correlated topics. We find that
                    our best performing textual model is most associated with topics that are
                    intuitively related to each prediction task and that better models yield higher
                    correlation with more informative topics.1},

The recent work Olteanu et al. proposes a number of features (linguistic and social) to apply machine learning methods to recognize trust levels. We demonstrate that this approach can be substantially improved in two ways: by applying machine learning methods to vectors computed, using psychosocial and psycholinguistic features and in a high-dimensional bag-of-words paradigm of word occurrences. Following Olteanu et al., we test the methods in two classification settings, as a 2-class and 3-class scenario, and in a regression setting. In the 3-class scenario, the features compiled by Olteanu et al. achieve weighted precision of 0.63, while the methods proposed in our paper raise it to 0.66 and 0.70. We also examine coefficients of the models in order to discover words associated with low and high trust.},

abstract = {In this article, we introduce and analyze an extension to the matching problem on a weighted bipartite graph (i.e., the assignment problem): Assignment with Type Constraints. Here, the two parts of the graph are each partitioned into subsets, called types and blocks, respectively; we seek a matching with the largest sum of weights under the constraint that there is a pre-specified cap on the number of vertices matched in every type-block pair. Our primary motivation stems from the large-scale public housing program run by the state of Singapore, accounting for over 70% of its residential real estate. To promote ethnic diversity within its housing projects, Singapore imposes ethnicity quotas: The population is divided into ethnicity-based groups and each new housing development into blocks of flats such that each group must not own more than a certain percentage of flats in a block. However, other domains use similar hard capacity constraints to maintain diversity: These include matching prospective students to schools or medical residents to hospitals. Limiting agents’ choices for ensuring diversity in this manner naturally entails some welfare loss. One of our goals is to study the tradeoff between diversity and (utilitarian) social welfare in such settings. We first show that, while the classic assignment program is polynomial-time computable, adding diversity constraints makes the problem computationally intractable; however, we identify a ½-approximation algorithm, as well as reasonable assumptions on the structure of utilities (or weights) that permit poly-time algorithms. Next, we provide two upper bounds on the price of diversity—a measure of the loss in welfare incurred by imposing diversity constraints—as functions of natural problem parameters. We conclude the article with simulations based on publicly available data from two diversity-constrained allocation problems—Singapore Public Housing and Chicago School Choice—which shed light on how the constrained maximization as well as lottery-based variants perform in practice.},

abstract = {Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is a preferred Machine Translation approach to convert the text in a specific language into another by automatically learning translations using a parallel corpus. SMT has been successful in producing quality translations in many foreign languages, but there are only a few works attempted in South Indian languages. The article discusses on experiments conducted with SMT for Malayalam language and analyzes how the methods defined for SMT in foreign languages affect a Dravidian language, Malayalam. The baseline SMT model does not work for Malayalam due to its unique characteristics like agglutinative nature and morphological richness. Hence, the challenge is to identify where precisely the SMT model has to be modified such that it adapts the challenges of the language peculiarity into the baseline model and give better translations for English to Malayalam translation. The alignments between English and Malayalam sentence pairs, subjected to the training process in SMT, plays a crucial role in producing quality output translation. Therefore, this work focuses on improving the translation model of SMT by refining the alignments between English–Malayalam sentence pairs. The phrase alignment algorithms align the verb and noun phrases in the sentence pairs and develop a new set of alignments for the English–Malayalam sentence pairs. These alignment sets refine the alignments formed from Giza++ produced as a result of EM training algorithm. The improved Phrase-Based SMT model trained using these refined alignments resulted in better translation quality, as indicated by the AER and BLUE scores.},

abstract = {The ability to anticipate human actions is critical to many cyber-physical systems, such as robots and autonomous vehicles. Computer vision and sensing algorithms to date have focused on extracting and predicting visual features that are explicit in the scene, such as color, appearance, actions, positions, and velocities, using video and physical measurements, such as object depth and motion. Human actions, however, are intrinsically influenced and motivated by many implicit factors such as context, human roles and interactions, past experience, and inner goals or intentions. For example, in a sport team, the team strategy, player role, and dynamic circumstances driven by the behavior of the opponents, all influence the actions of each player. This article proposes a holistic framework for incorporating visual features, as well as hidden information, such as social roles, and domain knowledge. The approach, relying on a novel dynamic Markov random field (DMRF) model, infers the instantaneous team strategy and, subsequently, the players’ roles that are temporally evolving throughout the game. The results from the DMRF inference stage are then integrated with instantaneous visual features, such as individual actions and position, in order to perform holistic action anticipation using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The approach is demonstrated on the team sport of volleyball, by first training the DMRF and MLP offline with past videos, and, then, by applying them to new volleyball videos online. These results show that the method is able to infer the players’ roles with an average accuracy of 86.99%, and anticipate future actions over a sequence of up to 46 frames with an average accuracy of 80.50%. Additionally, the method predicts the onset and duration of each action achieving a mean relative error of 14.57% and 15.67%, respectively.},

abstract = {Social Internet content plays an increasingly critical role in many domains, including public health, disaster management, and politics. However, its utility is limited by missing geographic information; for example, fewer than 1.6% of Twitter messages (tweets) contain a geotag. We propose a scalable, content-based approach to estimate the location of tweets using a novel yet simple variant of gaussian mixture models. Further, because real-world applications depend on quantified uncertainty for such estimates, we propose novel metrics of accuracy, precision, and calibration, and we evaluate our approach accordingly. Experiments on 13 million global, comprehensively multi-lingual tweets show that our approach yields reliable, well-calibrated results competitive with previous computationally intensive methods. We also show that a relatively small number of training data are required for good estimates (roughly 30,000 tweets) and models are quite time-invariant (effective on tweets many weeks newer than the training set). Finally, we show that toponyms and languages with small geographic footprint provide the most useful location signals.},

abstract = {Group decision making plays a crucial role in our complex and interconnected world. The rise of AI technologies has the potential to provide data-driven insights to facilitate group decision making, although it is found that groups do not always utilize AI assistance appropriately. In this paper, we aim to examine whether and how the introduction of a devil’s advocate in the AI-assisted group decision making processes could help groups better utilize AI assistance and change the perceptions of group processes during decision making. Inspired by the exceptional conversational capabilities exhibited by modern large language models (LLMs), we design four different styles of devil’s advocate powered by LLMs, varying their interactivity (i.e., interactive vs. non-interactive) and their target of objection (i.e., challenge the AI recommendation or the majority opinion within the group). Through a randomized human-subject experiment, we find evidence suggesting that LLM-powered devil’s advocates that argue against the AI model’s decision recommendation have the potential to promote groups’ appropriate reliance on AI. Meanwhile, the introduction of LLM-powered devil’s advocate usually does not lead to substantial increases in people’s perceived workload for completing the group decision making tasks, while interactive LLM-powered devil’s advocates are perceived as more collaborating and of higher quality. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of our findings.},

abstract = {Mounting evidence indicates that the artificial intelligence (AI) systems that rank our social media feeds bear nontrivial responsibility for amplifying partisan animosity: negative thoughts, feelings, and behaviors toward political out-groups. Can we design these AIs to consider democratic values such as mitigating partisan animosity as part of their objective functions? We introduce a method for translating established, vetted social scientific constructs into AI objective functions, which we term societal objective functions, and demonstrate the method with application to the political science construct of anti-democratic attitudes. Traditionally, we have lacked observable outcomes to use to train such models-however, the social sciences have developed survey instruments and qualitative codebooks for these constructs, and their precision facilitates translation into detailed prompts for large language models. We apply this method to create a democratic attitude model that estimates the extent to which a social media post promotes anti-democratic attitudes, and test this democratic attitude model across three studies. In Study 1, we first test the attitudinal and behavioral effectiveness of the intervention among US partisans (N=1,380) by manually annotating (alpha=.895) social media posts with anti-democratic attitude scores and testing several feed ranking conditions based on these scores. Removal (d=.20) and downranking feeds (d=.25) reduced participants' partisan animosity without compromising their experience and engagement. In Study 2, we scale up the manual labels by creating the democratic attitude model, finding strong agreement with manual labels (rho=.75). Finally, in Study 3, we replicate Study 1 using the democratic attitude model instead of manual labels to test its attitudinal and behavioral impact (N=558), and again find that the feed downranking using the societal objective function reduced partisan animosity (d=.25). This method presents a novel strategy to draw on social science theory and methods to mitigate societal harms in social media AIs.},

It provides a textbook, reference, and technology roadmap for professionals working in this and related areas.This second volume of the handbook begins with multimodal signal processing, architectures, and machine learning. It includes recent deep-learning approaches for processing multisensorial and multimodal user data and interaction, as well as context-sensitivity. A further highlight is processing of information about users' states and traits, an exciting emerging capability in next-generation user interfaces. These chapters discuss real-time multimodal analysis of emotion and social signals from various modalities and perception of affective expression by users. Further chapters discuss multimodal processing of cognitive state using behavioral and physiological signals to detect cognitive load, domain expertise, deception, and depression. This collection of chapters provides walk-through examples of system design and processing, information on tools and practical resources for developing and evaluating new systems, and terminology, and tutorial support for mastering this rapidly expanding field. In the final section of this volume, experts exchange views on the timely and controversial challenge topic of multimodal deep learning. The discussion focuses on how multimodal-multisensor interfaces are most likely to advance human performance during the next decade.}

abstract = {Event-based social networks (EBSNs) are becoming popular in recent years. Users can publish a planned event on an EBSN website, calling for other users to participate in the event. When a user is making a decision on whether to participate in an event in EBSNs, one aspect for consideration is existing participants defined as users who have agreed to join this event. Existing participants of the event may affect the decision of the user, to which we refer as participant influence. However, participant influence is not well studied by previous works. In this article, we propose an event recommendation model that considers participant influence, and exploits the influence of existing participants on the decisions of new participants based on Poisson factorization. The effect of participant influence is associated with the target event, the host group of the event, and the location of the event. Furthermore, our proposed model can extract latent event topics from event text descriptions, and characterize events, groups, and locations by distributions of event topics. Associations between latent event topics and participant influence are exploited for improving event recommendation. Besides making event recommendation, the proposed model is able to reveal the semantic properties of the participant influence between two users semantically. We have conducted extensive experiments on some datasets extracted from a real-world EBSN. Our proposed model achieves superior event recommendation performance over several state-of-the-art models. The results demonstrate that the consideration of participant influence can improve event recommendation.},

abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications. For more experienced researchers and practitioners, the discussions in this book provide guidance for adopting a human-centered design and development approach to advance affective computing},

abstract = {Identifying player motivations such as curiosity could help game designers analyze player profiles and substantially improve game design. However, research on player profiling focuses on generalized personality traits, not specific aspects of motivation. This study examines how player behaviour indicates constructs of curiosity-related motivation. It contributes a more discriminating operationalization of game-related curiosity. We derive a curiosity measure from established self-report survey methodologies relating to social capital, behavioural activation, obsessive/harmonious passion, and BrainHex player types. We present the results of a cross-sectional study with data from 1,745 players of Destiny--a popular shared-world first-person shooter (FPS) game. Behaviour metrics were paired with four curiosity factors: 'social' curiosity, 'sensory/cognitive' curiosity, 'novelty-seeking' curiosity, and 'explorative' curiosity. Our findings provide key insights into the relationships between players curiosity and their in-game behaviour. We infer curiosity-related motivational profiles from behaviour metrics, and discuss how this may impact game design and player-computer interaction.},

Autonomous vehicles present new challenges with interesting problems in several scientific fields, which are gradually being successfully solved. Social dilemmas, moral and ethical issues show different approaches. There is still an unsolvable problem of decision-making when it comes to the involvement of the ”trolley” problem. Autonomous vehicle software should within the future have flexibility to reconstruct collisions in order that the logic, ethics, and moral algorithm applied may be analyzed. This demands the existence of very good software and hardware technology that can record all the data during a collision.

abstract = {In the Internet age, malware (such as viruses, trojans, ransomware, and bots) has posed serious and evolving security threats to Internet users. To protect legitimate users from these threats, anti-malware software products from different companies, including Comodo, Kaspersky, Kingsoft, and Symantec, provide the major defense against malware. Unfortunately, driven by the economic benefits, the number of new malware samples has explosively increased: anti-malware vendors are now confronted with millions of potential malware samples per year. In order to keep on combating the increase in malware samples, there is an urgent need to develop intelligent methods for effective and efficient malware detection from the real and large daily sample collection. In this article, we first provide a brief overview on malware as well as the anti-malware industry, and present the industrial needs on malware detection. We then survey intelligent malware detection methods. In these methods, the process of detection is usually divided into two stages: feature extraction and classification/clustering. The performance of such intelligent malware detection approaches critically depend on the extracted features and the methods for classification/clustering. We provide a comprehensive investigation on both the feature extraction and the classification/clustering techniques. We also discuss the additional issues and the challenges of malware detection using data mining techniques and finally forecast the trends of malware development.},

Following up on the successful in-person conference held last year in Sweden, this year's theme is "HRI in the Real World," and focuses on advances that aim to bring human-robot interaction out of the lab and into everyday life.One aspect of this that we are very excited about is the introduction of a robot challenge to the conference activities, where teams from around the world will showcase their research and development via actual, interactive robots in the "real world" of an academic conference. It is our hope that this feature will grow and develop over the coming years into a staple of the HRI conference.This year's HRI conference saw an impressive surge in global interest, with 352 full paper submissions from around the world, marking a significant 40% increase compared to the previous year. These papers were categorized under relevant thematic subcommittees and underwent a double-blind review process, a rebuttal phase, and selective shepherding by the HRI program committee. From this process, 87 outstanding papers (24.7%) were chosen for full presentation at the conference. Reflecting our joint sponsorship with IEEE and ACM, all accepted papers will be accessible in the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore.},

The development of distributed group decision systems are problem-specific, literally with no systematic support and so a high level of variability in terms of their effects. There is a lack of generic and comprehensive manner that can support the description of the actual decision-making processes precisely. In this paper, we propose a group decision description language. The language consists of the constructs of agent, protocol, decision rule, and constraint for representing group decisions generically, flexibly, while maintaining local autonomy. A protocol of Triple Assessment for breast cancer has been used as an example to demonstrate its application. The language has been further applied to a Consensus Protocol and a Coordinator Election Protocol to demonstrate its expressiveness.},

But as the world of business becomes more interconnected and global, enterprise data is no long a monolith; it is just a part of a vast web of data. Managing data on a world-wide scale is a key capability for any business today.The Semantic Web treats data as a distributed resource on the scale of the World Wide Web, and incorporates features to address the challenges of massive data distribution as part of its basic design. The aim of the first two editions was to motivate the Semantic Web technology stack from end-to-end; to describe not only what the Semantic Web standards are and how they work, but also what their goals are and why they were designed as they are. It tells a coherent story from beginning to end of how the standards work to manage a world-wide distributed web of knowledge in a meaningful way.The third edition builds on this foundation to bring Semantic Web practice to enterprise. Fabien Gandon joins Dean Allemang and Jim Hendler, bringing with him years of experience in global linked data, to open up the story to a modern view of global linked data. While the overall story is the same, the examples have been brought up to date and applied in a modern setting, where enterprise and global data come together as a living, linked network of data. Also included with the third edition, all of the data sets and queries are available online for study and experimentation at data.world/swwo.}

Existing protocol-based approaches, however, do not adequately treat the practical aspects of how roles bindings come about.Pippi addresses this problem of MAS instantiation. It proposes the notion of a metaprotocol, enacting which instantiates a MAS suitable for enacting a given protocol. Pippi demonstrates the subtleties involved in instantiating MAS arising from protocol composition, correlation, and decentralization. To address these subtleties and further support practical application patterns, we introduce an enhanced protocol language, with support for parameter types (including role and protocol typed parameters, for metaprotocols), interface flexibility, and binding constraints. We discuss the realization of our approach through an extended agent architecture, including the novel concept of a MAS adapter for contact management. We evaluate Pippi's expressiveness by demonstrating common patterns for agent discovery.},

We take smartphone audio inference a step further and demonstrate for the first time that it's possible to accurately estimate the number of people talking in a certain place -- with an average error distance of 1.5 speakers -- through unsupervised machine learning analysis on audio segments captured by the smartphones. Inference occurs transparently to the user and no human intervention is needed to derive the classification model. Our results are based on the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system called Crowd++, involving 120 participants in 10 very different environments. We show that no dedicated external hardware or cumbersome supervised learning approaches are needed but only off-the-shelf smartphones used in a transparent manner. We believe our findings have profound implications in many research fields, including social sensing and personal wellbeing assessment.},

Participants do not generally anticipate the disruptive changes to knowledge industries currently projected in common media and academic narratives. Participants do however envision generative AI may amplify four social forces currently shaping their industries: deskilling, dehumanization, disconnection, and disinformation.

Following previous works on public housing allocation, each item (or house) belongs to a block (or building) and each agent is assigned a type (e.g., ethnicity group). The allocation problem consists in assigning at most one item to each agent in a good way while respecting diversity constraints. Based on Schelling’s seminal work, we introduce a generic individual utility function where the welfare of an agent not only relies on her preferences over the items but also takes into account the fraction of agents of her own type in her own block. In this context, we investigate the issue of stability, understood here as the absence of mutually improving swaps, and we define the cost of requiring it. Then, we study the behaviour of two existing allocation mechanisms: an adaptation of the sequential mechanism used in Singapore and a distributed procedure based on mutually improving swaps of items. We first present the theoretical properties of these two allocation mechanisms, and we then compare their performances in practice through an experimental study.},

abstract = {Automatic crime classification is a fundamental task in the legal field. Given the fact descriptions, judges first determine the relevant violated laws, and then the articles. As laws and articles are grouped into a tree-shaped hierarchy (i.e., laws as parent labels, articles as children labels), this task can be naturally formalized as a two layers' hierarchical multi-label classification problem. Generally, the label semantics (i.e., definition of articles) and the hierarchical structure are two informative properties for judges to make a correct decision. However, most previous methods usually ignore the label structure and feed all labels into a flat classification framework, or neglect the label semantics and only utilize fact descriptions for crime classification, thus the performance may be limited. In this paper, we formalize crime classification problem into a matching task to address these issues. We name our model as Hierarchical Matching Network (HMN for short). Based on the tree hierarchy, HMN explicitly decomposes the semantics of children labels into the residual and alignment components. The residual components keep the unique characteristics of each individual children label, while the alignment components capture the common semantics among sibling children labels, which are further aggregated as the representation of their parent label. Finally, given a fact description, a co-attention metric is applied to effectively match the relevant laws and articles. Experiments on two real-world judicial datasets demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods.},

Independent journalists who combat disinformation in underrepresented communities have reported feeling overwhelmed because they lack the tools necessary to make sense of the information they monitor and address the data voids. In this paper, we present a system to identify and address political data voids within underrepresented communities. Armed with an interview study, indicating that the independent news media has the potential to address them, we designed an intelligent collaborative system, called Datavoidant. Datavoidant uses state-of-the-art machine learning models and introduces a novel design space to provide independent journalists with a collective understanding of data voids to facilitate generating content to cover the voids. We performed a user interface evaluation with independent news media journalists (N=22). These journalists reported that Datavoidant's features allowed them to more rapidly while easily having a sense of what was taking place in the information ecosystem to address the data voids. They also reported feeling more confident about the content they created and the unique perspectives they had proposed to cover the voids. We conclude by discussing how Datavoidant enables a new design space wherein individuals can collaborate to make sense of their information ecosystem and actively devise strategies to prevent disinformation.},

abstract = {The objective of technology-assisted review ("TAR") is to find as much relevant information as possible with reasonable effort. Quality is a measure of the extent to which a TAR method achieves this objective, while reliability is a measure of how consistently it achieves an acceptable result. We are concerned with how to define, measure, and achieve high quality and high reliability in TAR. When quality is defined using the traditional goal-post method of specifying a minimum acceptable recall threshold, the quality and reliability of a TAR method are both, by definition, equal to the probability of achieving the threshold. Assuming this definition of quality and reliability, we show how to augment any TAR method to achieve guaranteed reliability, for a quantifiable level of additional review effort. We demonstrate this result by augmenting the TAR method supplied as the baseline model implementation for the TREC 2015 Total Recall Track, measuring reliability and effort for 555 topics from eight test collections. While our empirical results corroborate our claim of guaranteed reliability, we observe that the augmentation strategy may entail disproportionate effort, especially when the number of relevant documents is low. To address this limitation, we propose stopping criteria for the model implementation that may be applied with no additional review effort, while achieving empirical reliability that compares favorably to the provably reliable method. We further argue that optimizing reliability according to the traditional goal-post method is inconsistent with certain subjective aspects of quality, and that optimizing a Taguchi quality loss function may be more apt.},

abstract = {The strong anonymity and hard-to-track mechanisms of the dark web provide shelter for illegal activities. The illegal content on the dark web is diverse and frequently updated. Traditional dark web classification uses large-scale web pages for supervised training. However, the difficulty of collecting enough illegal dark web content and the time consumption of manually labeling web pages have become challenges of current research. In this paper, we propose a method that can effectively classify illegal activities on the dark web. Instead of relying on the massive dark web training set, we creatively select laws and regulations related to each type of illegal activities to train the machine learning classifiers and achieve a good classification performance. In the areas of pornography, drugs, weapons, hackers, and counterfeit credit cards, we select relevant legal documents from the United States Code for supervised training and conduct a classification experiment on the illegal content of the real dark web we collected. The results show that combined with TF-IDF feature extraction and Naive Bayes classifier, we achieved an accuracy of 0.935 in the experimental environment. Our approach allows researchers and the network law enforcement to check whether their dark web corpus contains such illegal activities based on the relevant laws of the illegal categories they care about in order to detect and monitor potential illegal websites in a timely manner. And because neither a large training set nor the seed keywords provided by experts are needed, this classification method provides another idea for the definition of illegal activities on the dark web. Moreover, it makes sense to help explore and discover new types of illegal activities on the dark web.},

abstract = {Abstractive dialogue summarization generates a concise and fluent summary covering the salient information in a dialogue among two or more interlocutors. It has attracted significant attention in recent years based on the massive emergence of social communication platforms and an urgent requirement for efficient dialogue information understanding and digestion. Different from news or articles in traditional document summarization, dialogues bring unique characteristics and additional challenges, including different language styles and formats, scattered information, flexible discourse structures, and unclear topic boundaries. This survey provides a comprehensive investigation of existing work for abstractive dialogue summarization from scenarios, approaches to evaluations. It categorizes the task into two broad categories according to the type of input dialogues, i.e., open-domain and task-oriented, and presents a taxonomy of existing techniques in three directions, namely, injecting dialogue features, designing auxiliary training tasks, and using additional data. A list of datasets under different scenarios and widely accepted evaluation metrics are summarized for completeness. After that, the trends of scenarios and techniques are summarized, together with deep insights into correlations between extensively exploited features and different scenarios. Based on these analyses, we recommend future directions, including more controlled and complicated scenarios, technical innovations and comparisons, publicly available datasets in special domains, and so on.},

abstract = {In the context of social media, users tend to post relevant information corresponding to an event mentioned in a Web document. This paper presents a model to capture the nature of the relationships between sentences and user posts such as relevant comments in sharing hidden topics for enriching summarization. Unlike the previous methods which usually base on hand-crafted features, our approach ranks sentences and comments based on their importance affecting the topics. The sentence-comment relation is formulated in a share topic matrix, which presents their mutual reinforcement support. Our newly proposed matrix co-factorization algorithm computes the score of each sentence and comment and extracts top m ranked sentences and m comments as the summarization. Experimental results on two datasets in English and Vietnamese of the social context summarization task and DUC 2004 confirm the efficiency of our model in summarizing Web documents.},

abstract = {Electronic medical records (EMR) in general provide significant benefits to healthcare organizations and clinicians. However, a major challenge of clinicians who use EMRs is the lowered perceived quality of patient-doctor communication and interaction as a result of doctors being distracted with EMR use during consultations. A unique approach to this problem is through applications that automatically document clinical encounters in real-time. This study aims to develop a speech transcriber plugin for a web-based EMR for real-time clinical encounter documentation. We make use of available speech-to-text services on the web as well as cTAKES for clinical annotation. A draft summary of the clinical encounter is presented to the user in editable SOAP format. Blockchain technology for the speech recording is also explored to secure access to the recording. Internal testings showed that the prototype is able to capture audio conversations into text and parse the transcription for medical concepts. However, after a single formal usability evaluation we found that there is much to be done in terms of the usability of the summarization component.},

abstract = {Technologies such as Wifi and BLE have been proven to be effective for indoor localization in two dimensional spaces with sufficiently good accuracy but the same techniques have large margin of errors when it comes to three dimensional spaces. Popular 3D spaces such as malls or airports are marked by distinct structural features - atrium/hollow space and large corridors which reduces spatial variability of WiFi and BLE signal strengths leading to erroneous location prediction. A large fraction of these errors can be attributed to vertical jumps where the predicted location has same horizontal coordinate as the actual location but differs in the vertical coordinate. Smartphones now come equipped with barometer sensor which could be used to solve this problem and create 3D localization solution having better accuracy. Research shows that the barometer can be used to determine relative vertical movement and its direction with nearly 100% accuracy. However exact floor prediction requires repeated calibration of the barometer measurements as pressure values vary significantly across device, time and locations. In this paper we present a method of automatically calibrating smartphone embedded barometers to provide accurate 3D localization. Our method combines a probabilistic learning method with a pressure drift elimination algorithm. We also show that when the floor value is accurately predicted, Wifi localization accuracy improves by 25% for 3D spaces. We validate our techniques in a real shopping mall and provide valuable insights from practical experiences.},

ASONAM 2022 was the fourteenth annual conference in the successful ASONAM conferences series and also the first hybrid version of the conference. Previous ASONAM conferences were held in Athens (2009), Odense (2010), Kaohsiung (2011), Istanbul (2012), Niagara Falls (2013), Beijing (2014), Paris (2015), San Francisco (2016), Sydney (2017), Barcelona (2018), Vancouver (2019), Virtual (2020), Virtual (2021). The pre-pandemic locations of the conferences have enabled the participants to enjoy local sights and to engage in person-to-person interactions, making new contacts and form new scientific collaborations. These possibilities were only available in a limited form during the virtual conferences. As the covid pandemic seems to be moving towards an endemic form it was decided to have the conference in the hybrid form, as a move towards normal endemic in-person conferences.For more than a century, social networks have been studied in a variety of disciplines including sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics. The Internet, the social Web, and other large-scale, sociotechnological infrastructures have triggered a growing interest and resulted in significant methodological advancements in social network analysis and mining. Method development in graph theory, statistics, data mining, machine learning, and AI have inspired new research problems and, in turn, opens up further possibilities for application. These spiraling trends have led to a rising prominence of social network analysis and mining methods and tools in academia, politics, security, and business.},

abstract = {Donations to charity-based crowdfunding environments have been on the rise in the last few years. Unsurprisingly, deception and fraud in such platforms have also increased, but have not been thoroughly studied to understand what characteristics can expose such behavior and allow its automatic detection and blocking. Indeed, crowdfunding platforms are the only ones typically performing oversight for the campaigns launched in each service. However, they are not properly incentivized to combat fraud among users and the campaigns they launch: on the one hand, a platform’s revenue is directly proportional to the number of transactions (since the platform charges a fixed amount per donation); on the other hand, if a platform is transparent with respect to how much fraud it has, it may discourage potential donors from participating. In this paper, we take the first step in studying fraud in crowdfunding campaigns. We analyze data collected from different crowdfunding platforms, and annotate 700 campaigns as fraud or not. We compute various textual and image-based features and study their distributions and how they associate with campaign fraud. Using these attributes, we build machine learning classifiers, and show that it is possible to automatically classify such fraudulent behavior with up to 90.14% accuracy and 96.01% AUC, only using features available from the campaign’s description at the moment of publication (i.e., with no user or money activity), making our method applicable for real-time operation on a user browser.},

abstract = {Relational understanding is critical for a number of visually-rich documents (VRDs) understanding tasks. Through multi-modal pre-training, recent studies provide comprehensive contextual representations and exploit them as prior knowledge for downstream tasks. In spite of their impressive results, we observe that the widespread relational hints (e.g., relation of key/value fields on receipts) built upon contextual knowledge are not excavated yet. To mitigate this gap, we propose DocReL, a Document Relational Representation Learning framework. The major challenge of DocReL roots in the variety of relations. From the simplest pairwise relation to the complex global structure, it is infeasible to conduct supervised training due to the definition of relation varies and even conflicts in different tasks. To deal with the unpredictable definition of relations, we propose a novel contrastive learning task named Relational Consistency Modeling (RCM), which harnesses the fact that existing relations should be consistent in differently augmented positive views. RCM provides relational representations which are more compatible to the urgent need of downstream tasks, even without any knowledge about the exact definition of relation. DocReL achieves better performance on a wide variety of VRD relational understanding tasks, including table structure recognition, key information extraction and reading order detection.},

To gain a better understanding of the interaction between community members and dispatchers using text-based risk reporting systems, this study conducts a system log analysis ofLiveSafe, a community safety reporting system, to provide empirical evidence of the conversational patterns between users and dispatchers using both quantitative and qualitative methods. We created an ontology to capture information (e.g., location, attacker, target, weapon, start-time, and end-time, etc.) that dispatchers often collected from users regarding their incident tips. Applying the proposed ontology, we found that dispatchers often asked users for different information across varied event types (e.g.,Attacker forAbuse andAttack events,Target forHarassment events). Additionally, using emotion detection and regression analysis, we found an inconsistency in dispatchers' emotional support and responsiveness to users' messages between different organizations and between incident categories. The results also showed that users had a higher response rate and responded quicker when dispatchers provided emotional support. These novel findings brought significant insights to both practitioners and system designers, e.g., AI-based solutions to augment human agents' skills for improved service quality.},

abstract = {This book offers a compelling discussion of the digital dreams that have come true, their often unintended side effects (nightmares), and what must be done to counteract the nightmares. It is intended as an impetus to further conversation not only in homes and workplaces, but in academic courses and even legislative debates. Equally importantly, the book is a presentation of what digital technology professionals need to know about these topics and the actions they should undertake individually and in support of other citizens, societal initiatives, and government. The author begins by introducing the amazing progress made in digital technologies over the past 80 years. Pioneering engineers dreamed of potential uses of technology through their writing and technical achievements, further inspiring thousands of researchers to bring the dreams to life, and to dream new dreams as well. The second part of the book describes the myriad adverse side effects and unanticipated challenges that arose as those dreams were pursued and achieved. Examples include rampant misinformation on social media, ransomware, autonomous weapons, and the premature use of AI before it is reliable and safe.The book closes with a positive call to action, outlining ways to address the challenges through ethical career choices, careful analysis, thoughtful design, research, citizen engagement, legislation/regulation, and careful consideration of how bad actors may use technology. Readers of Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares should become more knowledgeable, wiser, and also cautiously optimistic, determined to affect positive changes through their design, creation, and use of technology.“Are you feeling happy about the role of information technology in the world today? You should read this book for a dose of reality. Are you in despair about it? This book is the prescription for that condition, too! Nobody else could cover the landscape as Ron Baecker does.” - Clayton Lewis, Emeritus Professor, University of Colorado Boulder“This book is a captivating review of important computing developments. Many things talked about as new today have been around for a long time. Much can be learned from the past. The book also teaches a careful and consistent method that enables the reader to do this kind of work as the need arises. The book suggests the need will arise.” - John Leslie King, Emeritus Professor, University of Michigan}

abstract = {Multiple object tracking methods in the state-of-the-art are challenged by appearance variation, environment changes and long-term occlusions. Exploiting multiple calibrated and frame synchronized cameras holds the promise of alleviating these problems, in particular, the one pertaining to occlusion. The practical realization of this idea faces the problem that the appearance of the same target can change through different cameras. Thus, particular care should be taken in order to enhance the computation of appearance distances between targets in multiple cameras. In this paper, we tackle the problem of multiple object multiple camera tracking by adopting a Markov Decision Process framework. We concentrate on the effect of the affinity function by discussing different possible implementations and validating their performance, in terms of the MOT metric and the ID measure, on the PETS 2009 and EPFL datasets. Our experimental result shows a significant improvement of multiple cameras approaches with a sufficiently large overlapping zone compared to single camera ones.},

abstract = {The last decade has seen a wave of technological innovation by police forces. While this development has attracted significant scholarly attention, little is known about the accompanying media coverage, which can play a significant role in public understanding and perception of such technologies. In this article, we examine how the UK press has reported on two specific types of police technology, individual risk assessment, and predictive area mapping, in the 2012–2021 period. We find that (i)&nbsp;press coverage peaked in 2018, before dropping sharply, (ii)&nbsp;press reports have grown significantly more negative, (iii)&nbsp;concerns about bias have become predominant, and (iv)&nbsp;some evidence that the police have become more reticent in their dealings with the press. We hypothesise that this has inadvertently contributed to a reduction in transparency, which risks further erosion of efforts to identify and mitigate potential harms. In light of these findings, we propose potential paths towards improving transparency.},

abstract = {The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has more than 100,000 members circling the globe, including trailblazing women who created ACM-W (ACM’s Committee on Women in Computing) in 1993. This book, published in celebration of ACM-W’s 30th birthday, divides the history of ACM-W into three parts.The first section provides a traditional history that details the evolution of ACM-W’s projects. In the next section, Rendering History allows the women of ACM-W to tell their own stories. What motivated them to trade personal time and energy for work that would change the face of computing for women and young girls? Among many others, Sue Black relates a story that spans her escape from two abusive homes to recognition for her computing accomplishments by both the late Queen of England and the current King. Kathy Kleiman describes her contributions to the field, including helping to rescue the wireless spectrum (now used by WiFi) from the (US) Federal Communications Commission’s plan to sell it. Bhavani Thuraisingham writes about her birth in Sri Lanka, an arranged marriage to a man eight years her senior, and cutting-edge research in the integration of cyber security and machine learning. The final section of the book provides an annotated bibliography of the research that launched ACM-W and continued to inform its projects over the next 30 years.ACM-W advocates internationally for the full engagement of women in all aspects of the computing field, providing a wide range of programs and services to ACM members and working in the larger community to advance the contributions of technical women. The main theme of ACM-W’s 30-year history as detailed in this book is the organization’s maturation from a US-centric organization to a global leader in supporting the advancement of women in computer science.“This is, quite simply, a book you won’t want to put down! What a wonderful collection of stories – blending personal and professional reflections – of many of the women who have been pioneers in computing and its roles in society, and in ACM-W. Gloria Childress Townsend is one of those pioneers and we owe her great thanks for putting together this captivating collection of stories, and for telling the very impressive and influential history of ACM-W.” - Bobby Schnabel, University of Colorado Boulder – co-founder of the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology}

abstract = {High cognitive load arises from complex time and safety-critical tasks, for example, mapping out flight paths, monitoring traffic, or even managing nuclear reactors, causing stress, errors, and lowered performance. Over the last five years, our research has focused on using the multimodal interaction paradigm to detect fluctuations in cognitive load in user behavior during system interaction. Cognitive load variations have been found to impact interactive behavior: by monitoring variations in specific modal input features executed in tasks of varying complexity, we gain an understanding of the communicative changes that occur when cognitive load is high. So far, we have identified specific changes in: speech, namely acoustic, prosodic, and linguistic changes; interactive gesture; and digital pen input, both interactive and freeform. As ground-truth measurements, galvanic skin response, subjective, and performance ratings have been used to verify task complexity.The data suggest that it is feasible to use features extracted from behavioral changes in multiple modal inputs as indices of cognitive load. The speech-based indicators of load, based on data collected from user studies in a variety of domains, have shown considerable promise. Scenarios include single-user and team-based tasks; think-aloud and interactive speech; and single-word, reading, and conversational speech, among others. Pen-based cognitive load indices have also been tested with some success, specifically with pen-gesture, handwriting, and freeform pen input, including diagraming. After examining some of the properties of these measurements, we present a multimodal fusion model, which is illustrated with quantitative examples from a case study.The feasibility of employing user input and behavior patterns as indices of cognitive load is supported by experimental evidence. Moreover, symptomatic cues of cognitive load derived from user behavior such as acoustic speech signals, transcribed text, digital pen trajectories of handwriting, and shapes pen, can be supported by well-established theoretical frameworks, including O'Donnell and Eggemeier's workload measurement [1986] Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory [Chandler and Sweller 1991], and Baddeley's model of modal working memory [1992] as well as McKinstry et al.'s [2008] and Rosenbaum's [2005] action dynamics work. The benefit of using this approach to determine the user's cognitive load in real time is that the data can be collected implicitly that is, during day-to-day use of intelligent interactive systems, thus overcomes problems of intrusiveness and increases applicability in real-world environments, while adapting information selection and presentation in a dynamic computer interface with reference to load.},

abstract = {Performance of document image understanding has been significantly fueled by encoding multi-modal information in recent years. However, existing works heavily rely on the superficial appearance of the observed data, resulting in counter-intuitive model behavior in many critical cases. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a common-sense knowledge augmented model CALM for document image understanding tasks. It firstly produces purified representations of document contents to extract key information and learn common-sense augmented representation for inputs. Then, relevant common-sense knowledge is extracted from the external ConceptNet knowledge base, and a derived knowledge graph is built to enhance the common-sense reasoning capability of CALM jointly. In order to further highlight the importance of common-sense knowledge in document image understanding, we propose the first question-answering dataset, CS-DVQA, focused on common-sense reasoning for document images, in which questions are answered by taking both document contents and common-sense knowledge into consideration. Through extensive evaluation, the proposed CALM approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models in three document image understanding tasks, including key information extraction(from 85.37 to 86.52), document image classification(from 96.08 to 96.17), document visual question answering(from 86.72 to 88.03).},

abstract = {For millions of users Twitter is an important communication platform, a social network, and a system for resource sharing. Likewise, scientists use Twitter to connect with other researchers, announce calls for papers, or share their thoughts. Filtering tweets, discovering other researchers, or finding relevant information on a topic of interest, however, is difficult since no directory of researchers on Twitter exists.In this paper we present an approach to identify Twitter accounts of researchers and demonstrate its utility for the discipline of computer science. Based on a seed set of computer science conferences we collect relevant Twitter users which we can partially map to ground-truth data. The mapping is leveraged to learn a model for classifying the remaining. To gain first insights into how researchers use Twitter, we empirically analyze the identified users and compare their age, popularity, influence, and social network.},

abstract = {The public sector faces several challenges, such as a number of external and internal demands for change, citizens' dissatisfaction and frustration with public sector organizations, that need to be addressed. An alternative to the traditional top-down development of public services is co-creation of public services. Co-creation promotes collaboration between stakeholders with the aim to create better public services and achieve public values. At the same time, data analytics has been fuelled by the availability of immense amounts of textual data. Whilst both co-creation and TA have been used in the private sector, we study existing works on the application of Text Analytics (TA) techniques on text data to support public service co-creation. We systematically review 75 of the 979 papers that focus directly or indirectly on the application of TA in the context of public service development. In our review, we analyze the TA techniques, the public service they support, public value outcomes, and the co-creation phase they are used in. Our findings indicate that the TA implementation for co-creation is still in its early stages and thus still limited. Our research framework promotes the concept and stimulates the strengthening of the role of Text Analytics techniques to support public sector organisations and their use of co-creation process. From policy-makers' and public administration managers' standpoints, our findings and the proposed research framework can be used as a guideline in developing a strategy for the designing co-created and user-centred public services.},

abstract = {The need for responsible data management intensifies with the growing impact of data on society. One central locus of the societal impact of data are Automated Decision Systems (ADS), socio-legal-technical systems that are used broadly in industry, non-profits, and government. ADS process data about people, help make decisions that are consequential to people's lives, are designed with the stated goals of improving efficiency and promoting equitable access to opportunity, involve a combination of human and automated decision making, and are subject to auditing for legal compliance and to public disclosure. They may or may not use AI, and may or may not operate with a high degree of autonomy, but they rely heavily on data.In this article, we argue that the data management community is uniquely positioned to lead the responsible design, development, use, and oversight of ADS. We outline a technical research agenda that requires that we step outside our comfort zone of engineering for efficiency and accuracy, to also incorporate reasoning about values and beliefs. This seems high-risk, but one of the upsides is being able to explain to our children what we do and why it matters.},

It is the foundational element that exists in the interactions between humans and technologies. However, the rapid innovation of technologies has accelerated their widespread exploitations, resulting in the trust relationships among people and technologies to become increasingly complex. In this age of eroding trust, exploring how to steer away from this trend towards sustaining and enhancing trust becomes critical. Through our review of the varying definitions and applications of trust in existing literature, we believe that there is another perspective to address the challenges of trust. In our paper, we propose a trust pyramid to investigate the causality factors that influence the decision to trust. We classify the trust pyramid into three classifications (i..e, Foundational, Supplemental, Innovative) according to the order of importance and deliberations. Within each classification, we also propose the causality factors that serve as key trust elements to influence any decision-making. We identify key challenges (e.g., the need for ethical technologies, regulations to keep pace with technological advancement), and address them by proposing viable initiatives that stakeholders can consider to build trust in a systematic manner.},

It provides a textbook, reference, and technology roadmap for professionals working in this and related areas.This third volume focuses on state-of-the-art multimodal language and dialogue processing, including semantic integration of modalities. The development of increasingly expressive embodied agents and robots has become an active test-bed for coordinating multimodal dialogue input and output, including processing of language and nonverbal communication. In addition, major application areas are featured for commercializing multimodal-multisensor systems, including automotive, robotic, manufacturing, machine translation, banking, communications, and others. These systems rely heavily on software tools, data resources, and international standards to facilitate their development. For insights into the future, emerging multimodal-multisensor technology trends are highlighted for medicine, robotics, interaction with smart spaces, and similar topics. Finally, this volume discusses the societal impact of more widespread adoption of these systems, such as privacy risks and how to mitigate them. The handbook chapters provide a number of walk-through examples of system design and processing, information on practical resources for developing and evaluating new systems, and terminology and tutorial support for mastering this emerging field. In the final section of this volume, experts exchange views on a timely and controversial challenge topic, and how they believe multimodal-multisensor interfaces need to be equipped to most effectively advance human performance during the next decade.}

The design is procedurally specified as part of the ordinary modeling workflow by defining goals for the illumination that should be attained and locations where luminaires may be installed to realize these goals. Additionally, constraints can be modeled that make the arrangement of the installed luminaires respect certain aesthetic and structural considerations. From this specification, the system automatically generates a lighting solution for any concrete model instance. The underlying, intricate joint optimization and constraint satisfaction problem is approached with a stochastic scheme that operates directly in the complex subspace where all constraints are observed. To navigate this subspace efficaciously, the actual lighting situation is taken into account. We demonstrate our system on multiple examples spanning a variety of architectural structures and lighting designs.},

While human-AI collaboration has been investigated in various domains, more research is needed to explore human perceptions and expectations of AI teammates in human-AI teaming. To achieve an in-depth understanding of how people perceive AI teammates and what they expect from AI teammates in human-AI teaming, we conducted a survey with 213 participants and a follow-up interview with 20 participants. Considering the context-dependency of teamwork, we chose to study human-AI teaming in the context of multiplayer online games as a case study. This study shows that people have mixed feelings toward AI teammates but hold a positive attitude toward future collaboration with AI teammates in general. Our findings highlight people's expectations for AI teammates in a rapidly changing collaborative environment (e.g., instrumental skills for in-game tasks, shared understanding between humans and AI, communication capabilities, human-like behaviors and performance), as well as factors that impact people's willingness to team up with AI teammates (e.g., pre-existing attitudes toward AI, previous collaboration experience with humans). We contribute to CSCW by shedding light on how AI should be structured in human-AI teaming to support highly complex collaborative activities in CSCW environments.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to analyze the general prospects for the digitalization of public administration in Russia, as well as to identify the factors that impede this process. The study is based on the application of the method of theoretical generalization. Various measures to improve the efficiency of public administration, to optimize the administrative apparatus are carried out on an ongoing basis in order to find a source of a fundamental breakthrough in increasing the efficiency of the administration process. Despite the significant work that has been done in recent years to create various online platforms for interaction between the government and society and the development of a mechanism for providing public and municipal services in an electronic form, in our country, the digitalization of public administration is still at an early stage.The scale of the changes taking place in our country and in the world in general is so great that digitalization is rightly regarded not only as a driver for development, but also as a driver for the emergence of new paradigms, in particular, of public administration. Additional difficulties in analyzing the problems of digital transformation of public administration are due to the presence of various, often contradictory views on this process, as well as administrative practices. It is necessary to evaluate the capabilities of various technology platforms to optimize the administration and communication process. Recent events related to the coronavirus pandemic have shown the importance of the prompt exchange of information for timely administrative decisions. The results of this study indicate the need to invest in human capital in order to optimize the process of digital transformation of public administration. The study allowed us to generalize the specific problems of Russia regarding digital transformation.},

It also has been spreading with multiple industries exploring their capabilities and new blockchain use cases springing up on a daily basis. Its emergence has brought a great deal of impact on how the information will be stored and processed securely. Furthermore, almost of advocates say that blockchain will disrupt and change everything from education to financial payments, insurance, intellectual property, healthcare,... in the years to come. However, a comprehensive survey on potential and issues of blockchain adoption in academy and industry has not been yet accomplished.

Either because it is a lengthy process, potentially expensive, sometimes unclear or simply scary, people will often avoid or withdraw from a judicial process, especially in those cases that involve relatively small amounts. This results in the giving up of a basic right, with the potential loss of rightful benefits. In this paper we briefly analyze the main aspects that impair access to Justice nowadays. We then move on to look at recent technological developments in the field of Online Dispute Resolution to argue that these can, in the near future, have a significant role in improving access to Justice. Specifically, we analyze the UMCourt Conflict Resolution Framework, developed by our research team, and address the different dimensions in which such tools contribute to make Justice more accessible, namely through better access to useful information, support in decision-making or more cost-effective processes.},

abstract = {As algorithms increasingly take managerial and governance roles, it is ever more important to build them to be perceived as fair and adopted by people. With this goal, we propose a procedural justice framework in algorithmic decision-making drawing from procedural justice theory, which lays out elements that promote a sense of fairness among users. As a case study, we built an interface that leveraged two key elements of the framework---transparency and outcome control---and evaluated it in the context of goods division. Our interface explained the algorithm's allocative fairness properties (standards clarity) and outcomes through an input-output matrix (outcome explanation), then allowed people to interactively adjust the algorithmic allocations as a group (outcome control). The findings from our within-subjects laboratory study suggest that standards clarity alone did not increase perceived fairness; outcome explanation had mixed effects, increasing or decreasing perceived fairness and reducing algorithmic accountability; and outcome control universally improved perceived fairness by allowing people to realize the inherent limitations of decisions and redistribute the goods to better fit their contexts, and by bringing human elements into final decision-making.},

abstract = {This book offers a compelling discussion of the digital dreams that have come true, their often unintended side effects (nightmares), and what must be done to counteract the nightmares. It is intended as an impetus to further conversation not only in homes and workplaces, but in academic courses and even legislative debates. Equally importantly, the book is a presentation of what digital technology professionals need to know about these topics and the actions they should undertake individually and in support of other citizens, societal initiatives, and government. The author begins by introducing the amazing progress made in digital technologies over the past 80 years. Pioneering engineers dreamed of potential uses of technology through their writing and technical achievements, further inspiring thousands of researchers to bring the dreams to life, and to dream new dreams as well. The second part of the book describes the myriad adverse side effects and unanticipated challenges that arose as those dreams were pursued and achieved. Examples include rampant misinformation on social media, ransomware, autonomous weapons, and the premature use of AI before it is reliable and safe.The book closes with a positive call to action, outlining ways to address the challenges through ethical career choices, careful analysis, thoughtful design, research, citizen engagement, legislation/regulation, and careful consideration of how bad actors may use technology. Readers of Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares should become more knowledgeable, wiser, and also cautiously optimistic, determined to affect positive changes through their design, creation, and use of technology.“Are you feeling happy about the role of information technology in the world today? You should read this book for a dose of reality. Are you in despair about it? This book is the prescription for that condition, too! Nobody else could cover the landscape as Ron Baecker does.” - Clayton Lewis, Emeritus Professor, University of Colorado Boulder“This book is a captivating review of important computing developments. Many things talked about as new today have been around for a long time. Much can be learned from the past. The book also teaches a careful and consistent method that enables the reader to do this kind of work as the need arises. The book suggests the need will arise.” - John Leslie King, Emeritus Professor, University of Michigan},

abstract = {Voice assistants comprehend and use complex natural language and have become more pervasive in people's homes. Many effects of these technologies on consumer behaviour and their implications for manufacturers and businesses are still unexplored in literature. This paper aims to understand the impact of anthropomorphism on consumer attitudes and behavioural intentions. More specifically, the paper intends to investigate 1) whether and 2) how anthropomorphism in voice assistants influences the manner consumers evaluate products and establish purchase intentions when shopping with voice assistants. Hence, the paper concludes that anthropomorphism plays a notable role in changing the consumer's attitude and behavioural intentions. However, its impact could be easily manipulated by other technical constraints such as interaction fluency, intent classification, lack of visual display etc. Multiple interpretation attempts are presented and possible implications for manufacturers and e-retailers discussed.},

abstract = {We propose Pathfinder, a variational method for approximately sampling from differentiable probability densities. Starting from a random initialization, Pathfinder locates normal approximations to the target density along a quasi-Newton optimization path, with local covariance estimated using the inverse Hessian estimates produced by the optimizer. Pathfinder returns draws from the approximation with the lowest estimated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the target distribution. We evaluate Pathfinder on a wide range of posterior distributions, demonstrating that its approximate draws are better than those from automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI) and comparable to those produced by short chains of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), as measured by 1-Wasserstein distance. Compared to ADVI and short dynamic HMC runs, Pathfinder requires one to two orders of magnitude fewer log density and gradient evaluations, with greater reductions for more challenging posteriors. Importance resampling over multiple runs of Pathfinder improves the diversity of approximate draws, reducing 1-Wasserstein distance further and providing a measure of robustness to optimization failures on plateaus, saddle points, or in minor modes. The Monte Carlo KL divergence estimates are embarrassingly parallelizable in the core Pathfinder algorithm, as are multiple runs in the resampling version, further increasing Pathfinder's speed advantage with multiple cores.},

abstract = {Object detection for remote sensing images (RSI) has made significant progress in recent years. However, existing supervised methods typically require a large amount of labeled data, whose acquisition, and particularly that of RSI, can be quite expensive. For natural images, many semi-supervised methods have been proposed to tackle the lack of labeled data, while few studies have focused on semi-supervised object detection for RSI. To address this problem, this paper proposes RS-PCL, which is a semi-supervised method applying Pseudo labeling and Consistency Learning to RSI. The RS-PCL method uses the teacher-student training scheme to generate high-quality pseudo labels for self-training. To deal with biased pseudo boxes, Noisy Pseudo box Assignment (NPA) is proposed to consider the teacher predictions during the label assignments of the unlabeled student. To ensure scale invariance, Scale-Invariant Learning (SIL) is proposed to carry out feature-consistency training on multi-scale images. This study conducted experiments using the DOTA-v1.0 dataset as labeled data and newly added images in the DOTA-v2.0 dataset (DOTA-v2.0 was constructed by adding extra images to DOTA-v1.0) as unlabeled data. The results reveal that there is obvious improvement over the supervised baseline and state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Software history has a deep impact on current software designers, computer scientists, and technologists. System constraints imposed in the past and the designs that responded to them are often unknown or poorly understood by students and practitioners, yet modern software systems often include “old” software and “historical” programming techniques. This work looks at software history through specific software areas to develop student-consumable practices, design principles, lessons learned, and trends useful in current and future software design. It also exposes key areas that are widely used in modern software, yet infrequently taught in computing programs. Written as a textbook, this book uses specific cases from the past and present to explore the impact of software trends and techniques.Building on concepts from the history of science and technology, software history examines such areas as fundamentals, operating systems, programming languages, programming environments, networking, and databases. These topics are covered from their earliest beginnings to their modern variants. There are focused case studies on UNIX, APL, SAGE, GNU Emacs, Autoflow, internet protocols, System R, and others. Extensive problems and suggested projects enable readers to deeply delve into the history of software in areas that interest them most.}

abstract = {Explainable recommenders are systems that explain why an item is recommended, in addition to suggesting relevant items to the users of the system. Although explanations are known to be able to significantly affect a user's decision-making process, significant gaps remain concerning methodologies to evaluate them. This hinders cross-comparison between explainable recommendation approaches and is one of the issues hampering the widespread adoption of explanations in industry settings. The goal of QUARE '22 was to promote discussion upon future research and practice directions around evaluation methodologies for explanations in recommender systems. To that end, we brought together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry in a half-day event, co-located with SIGIR 2022. The workshop's program included two keynote talks, three sessions of technical paper presentations in the form of lightning talks followed by panel discussions, and a final plenary discussion session. Although the area of explanations for recommender systems is still in its early stages, QUARE saw the participation of researchers and practitioners from several fields, laying the groundwork for the creation of a community around this topic and indicating promising directions for future research and development.Date: 15 July, 2022.Website: https://sites.google.com/view/quare-2022/home.},

In this paper, we use a participatory approach to determine a course forward for research and development in this area. We draw attention to the needs and expectations of people directly affected by these systems, i.e., jobseekers. Our investigation comprises two workshops: the first a fact-finding workshop with academics, system developers, the public sector, and civil-society organizations, the second a co-design workshop with 13 unemployed migrants to Germany. Based on the discussion in the fact-finding workshop we identified challenges of existing PES (algorithmic) systems. From the co-design workshop we identified our participants’ needs and desires when contacting PES: the need for human contact, the expectation to receive genuine orientation, and the desire to be seen as a whole human being. We map these expectations to three design considerations for data-driven and algorithmic systems for PES: the importance of interpersonal interaction, jobseeker assessment as direction, and the challenge of mitigating misrepresentation. Finally, we argue that the limitations and risks of current systems cannot be addressed through minor adjustments but require a more fundamental change to the role of PES.},

abstract = {As the digital era unfolds, social media supported by mobile devices and AI technologies are rapidly changing the way people communicate. The impact of public opinion formed on the social network platforms often has an enormous and somehow long-lasting influence on a country's foreign policy and international relations, and international interactions in the form of Twiplomacy are gradually attracting the attention of researchers.However, the attempts to analyze the impact that online public opinion has on actual policy or the inverse are still lacking or failed to explain the problem on the socioeconomic ground. There are very few theoretical explanations of how different pandemic narratives emerges and co-exists, and yet no article that analyzed how the positive and negative narratives about China spread and wrestled in their respective public opinion arenas during such a global event.Under certain analogous sense, Virus like the rumor “China virus “and vaccines like the encouraging reports we get from the “China Aid Activities in Italy” are fighting each other in the social media battleground and thus in every individual's mind which finally aggregated as the ideology. Hence, to explain the underlying motives for the public to accept and spread different pandemic narratives, we combined the modified SIR model and Glaeser(2005) ' political economic dynamic to cast light on its deep route in the background of the U.S.-China trade conflict and the U.S. presidential election - all three Black swans landed in the same Lake.Our research combined the sentiment semantic analysis methods from the AI-NLP field with the causal mechanism analysis to evaluate the differences in the attitudes of the Italian &amp; international public towards China before and after the Chinese medical aid to Italy to fight the Covid-19 epidemic. Using the public data set from the GitHub project and other open-source scientific data, we applied the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model (BERT) on individual tweets to include both emotional and non-emotional terms from a sentence sematic scale rather than word meaning scale which allows us to dig-in rich in topical information and estimate the international image trend of China during the 2020 February-March period. Here inspired by hybrid enrichment framework proposed by Gencoglu &amp; Gruber (2020) but limited with the data, we choose the ARMA model instead to infer the sentimental level and the causality of medical aid event, empirical result shows that the positive change in Italy' public sentiment level is significantly affected by China's aid activities event here. The results of this article also provide insight into how China can improve its international image to promote the progress of many international regional economic and trade cooperation from the narrative perspective. Facts always speak louder than words, with which the adequate speed-up dissemination of fact is also important.},

abstract = {Conversation generation as a challenging task in Natural Language Generation (NLG) has been increasingly attracting attention over the last years. A number of recent works adopted sequence-to-sequence structures along with external knowledge, which successfully enhanced the quality of generated conversations. Nevertheless, few works utilized the knowledge extracted from similar conversations for utterance generation. Taking conversations in customer service and court debate domains as examples, it is evident that essential entities/phrases, as well as their associated logic and inter-relationships, can be extracted and borrowed from similar conversation instances. Such information could provide useful signals for improving conversation generation. In this paper, we propose a novel reading and memory framework called Deep Reading Memory Network (DRMN) which is capable of remembering useful information of similar conversations for improving utterance generation. We apply our model to two large-scale conversation datasets of justice and e-commerce fields. Experiments prove that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {When Sir Tim Berners-Lee first proposed the foundations of the World Wide Web at CERN in 1989, his manager called it “vague, but exciting.” How things have changed since then! Twenty-six years later, Berners-Lee won the ACM Turing Award “for inventing the World Wide Web, the first Web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale.” This book is a compilation of articles on the original ideas of a true visionary and the subsequent research and development work he has led, helping to realize the Web’s full potential. It is intended for readers interested in the Web’s original technical development, how it has changed over time, and the social impacts of the Web as steered by Berners-Lee since the very beginning.The book covers Berners-Lee's development of the key protocols, naming schemes, and markup languages that led to his “world wide web” program and ultimately to the Web as we know it today. His early efforts were refined as Web technology spread around the world, and he was further guided by the work of the World Wide Web Consortium, which he founded and still directs. He was instrumental in the conceptualization and realization of the Semantic Web, a field that is gaining momentum in the age of big data and knowledge graphs; was a driving force for the field of Web Science, a new and growing research area dedicated to the study of both the engineering and the impacts of the Web; and he continues to innovate through his research work at MIT on open and decentralized information. Berners-Lee is also known for his contributions to keeping the Web open and ubiquitous via his work with the World Wide Web Foundation, the UK's Open Data Institute and his recent call for a crowdsourced magna carta for the Web. This book will help the reader to understand how Sir Tim’s invention of the World Wide Web has revolutionized not just Computer Science, but global society itself.}

How might designers of these platforms effectively navigate their complex ecology and sociotechnical dynamics? To explore this question, we interviewed designers building mental health technologies who undertook this challenge. They are hospital chief medical information officers and startup founders together striving to create new sensors/AI platforms and integrate them into the healthcare ecosystem. We found that, while all designers aspired to build comprehensive care platforms, their efforts focused on serving either consumers or physicians, delivering a subset of healthcare interventions, and demonstrating system effectiveness one metric at a time. Consequently, breakdowns in patient journeys are emerging; societal risks loom large. We describe how the data economy, designers’ mindsets, and evaluation challenges led to these unintended design consequences. We discuss implications for designing pervasive sensing and AI platforms for social good.},

We distinguish between a negative component of dominance (automation bias) and a positive one (algorithm appreciation) by focusing on and systematizing the patterns of interaction between human judgment and AI support, or reliance patterns, and their associated cognitive effects. We then define statistical approaches for measuring these dimensions of dominance, as well as corresponding qualitative visualizations. By reporting about four medical case studies, we illustrate how the proposed methods can be used to inform assessments of dominance and of related cognitive biases in real-world settings. Our study lays the groundwork for future investigations into the effects of introducing AI support into naturalistic and collaborative decision-making.},

However, there are also defects during its application, taking law curriculum as an example, which mainly reflected in the limited scope, the difficulty of achieving education and training goals, and the lack of scientific evaluation mechanisms. The results reveal the improvement prospect of MOOC, educators need to explore a teacher-student “Dual-Dominant” curriculum system which focuses on the teaching quality, continuously optimize the evaluation mechanism through an complementary assessment with "Online-Offline" feature, expanding the sharing of educational resources between schools and enterprises, and explore newly technologies such as Metaverse and virtual reality techniques in order to mobilize learners' enthusiasm for autonomous learning. The future development of MOOC should focus on the transformation and upgrading of educational concepts, as well as the sharing and interoperability of high-quality teaching resources, and provide more fair, convenient and economical personalized learning opportunities for global participants. As MOOC is a typical educational resources sharing platform, and its functional optimization depends on the participants feedbacks, which need pay more attention to.},

abstract = {As new forms of data capture emerge to power new AI applications, questions abound about the ethical implications of these data collection practices. In this paper, we present clinicians' perspectives on the prospective benefits and harms of voice data collection during health consultations. Such data collection is being proposed as a means to power models to assist clinicians with medical data entry, administrative tasks, and consultation analysis. Yet, clinicians' attitudes and concerns are largely absent from the AI narratives surrounding these use cases, and the academic literature investigating them. Our qualitative interview study used the concept of an informed consent process as a type of design fiction, to support elicitation of clinicians' perspectives on voice data collection and use associated with a fictional, near-term AI assistant. Through reflexive thematic analysis of in-depth sessions with physicians, we distilled eight classes of potential risks that clinicians are concerned about, including workflow disruptions, self-censorship, and errors that could impact patient eligibility for services. We conclude with an in-depth discussion of these prospective risks, reflect on the use of the speculative processes that illuminated them, and reconsider evaluation criteria for AI-assisted clinical documentation technologies in light of our findings.},

Part of the goal is to spread the engineering concepts, tools, technology and knowledge to non-major students, which might be adopted to their own major study and research. At the same time, team-based projects are implemented in the class to foster collaboration between students from different background and disciplines to achieve education purpose.},

abstract = {Australia, Denmark and the Republic of Korea are among the most connected countries in the world, with high-speed infrastructure widely available and with high rates of internet use by businesses and individuals alike. The three countries are also among the front-runners when it comes to the utilisation of Information Communication Technology (ICT) in the public sector and have all showed significant achievements related to the digital transformation of public services production and delivery. Although many factors may account for their successes, what is the role played by their strategic approach to governance and inter-governmental cooperation models? How have governance and multi-stakeholder coordination and cooperation approach influences the success of the digital transformation and boost innovations in each of the three cases?The initial findings of this paper support academic that the digital transformation of the public sector largely depends on the focus, governance and intergovernmental coordination and cooperation. Specifically in guiding the use of ICT in building an efficient and user-oriented whole-of-government ecosystem for public service production and delivery. The analysis finds that a strong governance model with clear roles and responsibilities of all institutions complement with formal cross-sectoral bodies for decision-making and ensuring inter-governmental coordination and cooperation are essential for successful digital transformation. High levels of inclusiveness on across all levels of government, society and end-user groups is seen as a positive factor in all three countries. As a result, the success rate of the implementation of their respective ICT/Digital/eGovernment strategies is high, resulting with successful development of the ICT infrastructure, roll-out of key enablers, interoperability systems, technical and legal standards that allowed them as global leaders to move towards real user-centric, integrated service production and delivery. However, to verify the findings, this paper also identifies a set of “leap-frogging” countries for further research.},

abstract = {This book demonstrates the need for and the value of interdisciplinary research in addressing important societal challenges associated with the widespread use of algorithmic decision-making. Algorithms are increasingly being used to make decisions in various domains such as criminal justice, medicine, and employment. While algorithmic tools have the potential to make decision-making more accurate, consistent, and transparent, they pose serious challenges to societal interests. For example, they can perpetuate discrimination, cause representational harm, and deny opportunities.The Societal Impacts of Algorithmic Decision-Making presents several contributions to the growing body of literature that seeks to respond to these challenges, drawing on techniques and insights from computer science, economics, and law. The author develops tools and frameworks to characterize the impacts of decision-making and incorporates models of behavior to reason about decision-making in complex environments. These technical insights are leveraged to deepen the qualitative understanding of the impacts of algorithms on problem domains including employment and lending.The social harms of algorithmic decision-making are far from being solved. While easy solutions are not presented here, there are actionable insights for those who seek to deploy algorithms responsibly. The research presented within this book will hopefully contribute to broader efforts to safeguard societal values while still taking advantage of the promise of algorithmic decision-making.}

We don't do this simply to shed light but to influence change. We stand when others are forced to sit and speak when others are silenced. For many of us, the past several years have rendered our usual tools ineffective, and often we find ourselves seated, scared to stand, and essentially silenced as we search for new language to describe old problems. We increasingly, and rightfully, feel frustrate... powerles... angry. Unfortunately, we sometimes allow these feelings to lead us to inaction. However, as the Black feminist scholar Audre Lorde wrote in her masterpiece, Sister Outsider, anger, directed in productive ways, can be transformative.},

While we are sure that there will be a few surprises along the way, we hope and expect that we won't experience anything nearly as disruptive as the opening days of the pandemic, which occurred when we last tried to gather here in 2020.Our theme for this year's symposium is "Blazing New Trails in CS Education." This broad theme captures the exceptional work being performed by this community to enhance our teaching, improve our assessments, attract diverse students, and all of the other laudable projects, initiatives, and undertakings that affect positive change. The breadth of the program is substantial - there truly should be something for everyone. In fact, your biggest challenge may be deciding which session to attend in each time slot because there is so much going on! We know that many of you want to attend as many sessions as possible while you are here in Portland, but we encourage you to also find a little bit of time for yourself so that you leave Portland refreshed, renewed and encouraged, rather than exhausted or burnt out.},

The toolkit responds to the call to maintain the locality of data by promoting a qualitative and contextualized approach to analyzing Twitter data. We assessed the toolkit’s effectiveness in guiding practitioners to search, collect, and be critical when analyzing data from Twitter. We evaluated the toolkit with ten practitioners from three non-profit organizations of different aims and sizes in Mexico. The assessment surfaced tensions between the assumptions embedded in the toolkit’s design and practitioners’ expectations, needs, and backgrounds. We show that practitioners navigated these tensions in some cases by developing strategies and, in others, questioning the appropriateness of using Twitter data to inform their work. We conclude with recommendations for researchers who developed tools for non-profit organizations to inform humanitarian action.},

Crowds can explore many types of social and information networks, but we focus on the network of causal attributions, an important network that signifies cause-and-effect relationships. We conduct experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) testing how workers can propose and validate individual causal relationships and introduce a method for independent crowd workers to explore large networks. The core of the method, Iterative Pathway Refinement, is a theoretically-principled mechanism for efficient exploration via microtasks. We evaluate the method using synthetic networks and apply it on AMT to extract a large-scale causal attribution network. Worker interactions reveal important characteristics of causal perception and the generated network data can help improve our understanding of causality and causal inference.},

abstract = {With the advent of the New Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and the accelerated development of the urban centres, a new debate arises on how to use ICTs to enhance the development of cities and to make them smarter, in the way that theory has been pointing out as smart and human cities.In this sense, cities became big urban centres collecting data and the new possibilities arising out of it, such as the Big Data and other innovations such as the Internet of the Things (IOT) changed the scenario in terms of personal data. Thus being, this paper was oriented by this research question: how do public administrations deal with the treatment of personal data? For answering this question it was developed a framework whose primordial aim was to evaluate to what extent the Smart Cities projects adopt measures to ensure that the citizen has control on the data collected by the Administration (Digital Sovereignty).For the elaboration of this study it was used the method of monographic procedure, making essentially use of the research technique based on relevant literature review on Smart Cities, Governance and Data Protection. To the employment of these techniques it was added the case study, confronting theory with the practice undertaken by Operations Centre of Rio de Janeiro (OCR) and Integrated Management Centre of Porto (IMCP) concerning the governance of collected user's personal data. The preliminary results arising out of the application of an inquiry revealed that both OCR and IMCP do not present clear information on the treatment of the user's data neither in government portals nor as feedback, since they did not reply to the sent form. From this it may be inferred that the proposed maturity model appears as a valuable auxiliary tool for managers in the development of public policies for smart cities with a focus on data protection. Besides that it is also useful to fulfil academic gaps and, mainly, for the legal / normative production on the subject.},

It argues that an architectural perspective is helpful to bridging discursive and methodological gaps between information systems (IS) research and legal studies. Combining architectural and normative perspectives is a novel interdisciplinary research approach that provides a framework for analyzing techno-legal contexts. The merits and challenges of this approach are demonstrated and discussed in this paper using the example of COVID-19 contact tracing apps. We conceptualize our results on three levels of knowledge: the first is the actual knowledge of the exemplary contact tracing app we studied and its ecosystem; the second is knowledge of the architectural meta-model that we used, its benefits and its shortcomings; and the third is knowledge of the interdisciplinary research process of acquiring common knowledge shared by IS scholars and legal experts.},

System constraints imposed in the past and the designs that responded to them are often unknown or poorly understood by students and practitioners, yet modern software systems often include “old” software and “historical” programming techniques. This work looks at software history through specific software areas to develop student-consumable practices, design principles, lessons learned, and trends useful in current and future software design. It also exposes key areas that are widely used in modern software, yet infrequently taught in computing programs. Written as a textbook, this book uses specific cases from the past and present to explore the impact of software trends and techniques.Building on concepts from the history of science and technology, software history examines such areas as fundamentals, operating systems, programming languages, programming environments, networking, and databases. These topics are covered from their earliest beginnings to their modern variants. There are focused case studies on UNIX, APL, SAGE, GNU Emacs, Autoflow, internet protocols, System R, and others. Extensive problems and suggested projects enable readers to deeply delve into the history of software in areas that interest them most.},

In a process referred to as computational news discovery, alerts and leads based on data-driven algorithmic analysis can orient journalists' attention to events, documents, or anomalous patterns in data that are more likely to be newsworthy. In this paper we prototype one such news discovery tool, Algorithm Tips, which we designed to help journalists find newsworthy leads about algorithmic decision-making systems used across all levels of U.S. government. The tool incorporates algorithmic, crowdsourced, and expert evaluations into an integrated interface designed to support users in making editorial decisions about which news leads to pursue. We then present an evaluation of our prototype based on an extended deployment with eight professional journalists. Our findings offer insights into journalistic practices that are enabled and transformed by such news discovery tools, and suggest opportunities for improving computational news discovery tool designs to better support those practices.},

abstract = {Algorithmic decision-making systems are increasingly used throughout the public and private sectors to make important decisions or assist humans in making these decisions with real social consequences. While there has been substantial research in recent years to build fair decision-making algorithms, there has been less research seeking to understand the factors that affect people's perceptions of fairness in these systems, which we argue is also important for their broader acceptance. In this research, we conduct an online experiment to better understand perceptions of fairness, focusing on three sets of factors: algorithm outcomes, algorithm development and deployment procedures, and individual differences. We find that people rate the algorithm as more fair when the algorithm predicts in their favor, even surpassing the negative effects of describing algorithms that are very biased against particular demographic groups. We find that this effect is moderated by several variables, including participants' education level, gender, and several aspects of the development procedure. Our findings suggest that systems that evaluate algorithmic fairness through users' feedback must consider the possibility of "outcome favorability" bias.},

abstract = {China's legal profession is a new profession emerging in the process of China's rule of law. Its development and refinement are increasing in accordance with the rapid social, economic and political development. However, as a lawyer, people need to learn real kung fu. For complex and changeable legal practice problems, people should use the simplest and most effective way to solve them. Therefore, it is necessary to study the curriculum of law specialty to achieve its purpose. It is also necessary to reform the traditional education methods, introduce modern scientific and technological means, and improve their effectiveness, so as to construct a practical teaching mode of Professional Courses in Law (PCL). For practical legal courses, it can be conducted through multi-mode low-resource language learning method. This paper aimed to study how to study the ability of students to obtain information, process information and analyze and process information based on intelligent multi image feature fusion. Based on the investigation of teaching objectives and teachers' teaching requirements, and the analysis and arrangement of the investigation results, a multi task learning system model based on image intelligent features was established. In this experiment, 494 valid questionnaires were used to analyze the current situation of PCL practical teaching. Among them, 10.32% and 65.59% of the students were very satisfied with the results of PCL practical teaching, and 18.02% and 59.31% of the students liked PCL practical teaching very much; in the survey on the influencing factors of PCL practical teaching activities, 61.34% of the students thought that the students did not know enough and were not enthusiastic enough. On the whole, the students are satisfied with the practical teaching arrangement of PCL, but from the actual situation, the effect of practical teaching is not very good, and the expected goal has not been achieved.},

abstract = {In 2021 I realised that large swathes of the Internet were making me sad. I resolved to do something about it.The result was a focused, intense process of finding the mechanisms by which I could optimise my relationship with the online world. I resolved to focus on those things that brought me sustained happiness, as opposed to those things that merely offered transient pleasure. I ripped toxic websites out of my life, and limited my exposure to those I regarded as merely hazardous. The result was a battle to regain joy I once experienced in my online leisure activities - to regain my focus on electronic common ground, as opposed to digital battle grounds.Few technologies have reached so deeply into our lives - and into our sense of self - as the modern Internet. Social and psychological defence mechanisms that evolved for the context of a tribe simply do not survive at Internet scale. For all that social media is designed to link us together, in many ways it only serves to push us apart.This paper is a personal, autoethnographic reflection of how 'Project Unplug' was conceptualised, prepared, and executed over 2022. The specific combination of online vectors that were the cause of my unhappiness are unique to me.This paper though outlines a hopefully valuable approach to creating our own digital rituals and rites so as to create strong, inviolable limits on the extent to which the Internet might erode our personal happiness},

abstract = {In this study, a simulator is proposed for inspection and training of a wheel loader based on a first-person serious game and virtual reality. The simulator was developed using a cross-platform game engine and integrated into various virtual reality headsets. The goal of the game was to conduct maintenance inspection procedures on the wheel loader of a mining company. A group of 34 users tested the simulator and completed a survey. The results showed that the system is suitable for inspection and training of staff before they can use a real wheel loader at a mining company. The findings revealed that implementing a simulator for inspection and maintenance training can enhance the process, reducing expenses and increasing safety. In addition, methods in the real-world of training are scarcely sufficient to instruct operators in all dangerous situations. These methods are generally effective, but they do not give operators the real-life impression of all scenarios. In this sense, the serious game makes the training effective because it gives operators a sense of realism. Beyond, the simulator can be extended to include other types of procedures with several situations.},

abstract = {Sir Tony Hoare has had an enormous influence on computer science, from the Quicksort algorithm to the science of software development, concurrency and program verification. His contributions have been widely recognised: He was awarded the ACM’s Turing Award in 1980, the Kyoto Prize from the Inamori Foundation in 2000, and was knighted for “services to education and computer science” by Queen Elizabeth II of England in 2000.This book presents the essence of his various works—the quest for effective abstractions—both in his own words as well as chapters written by leading experts in the field, including many of his research collaborators. In addition, this volume contains biographical material, his Turing award lecture, the transcript of an interview and some of his seminal papers.Hoare’s foundational paper “An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming”, presented his approach, commonly known as Hoare Logic, for proving the correctness of programs by using logical assertions. Hoare Logic and subsequent developments have formed the basis of a wide variety of software verification efforts. Hoare was instrumental in proposing the Verified Software Initiative, a cooperative international project directed at the scientific challenges of large-scale software verification, encompassing theories, tools and experiments.Tony Hoare’s contributions to the theory and practice of concurrent software systems are equally impressive. The process algebra called Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) has been one of the fundamental paradigms, both as a mathematical theory to reason about concurrent computation as well as the basis for the programming language occam. CSP served as a framework for exploring several ideas in denotational semantics such as powerdomains, as well as notions of abstraction and refinement. It is the basis for a series of industrial-strength tools which have been employed in a wide range of applications.This book also presents Hoare’s work in the last few decades. These works include a rigorous approach to specifications in software engineering practice, including procedural and data abstractions, data refinement, and a modular theory of designs. More recently, he has worked with collaborators to develop Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP). Their goal is to identify the common algebraic theories that lie at the core of sequential, concurrent, reactive and cyber-physical computations. Theories of Programming: The Life and Works of Tony Hoare’ is available as a printed book (DOI: ) and an on-line version.

While recent research efforts are committed to improving the automatic retrieval models' performances, little attention has been paid to the practical search interactions between users and systems in this task. Therefore, we focus on investigating user behavior in the scenario of legal case retrieval. Specifically, we conducted a laboratory user study that involved 45 participants majoring in law to collect users' rich interactions and relevance assessments. With the collected data, we first analyzed the characteristics of the search process in legal case retrieval practice. We observed significant differences between legal case retrieval and general web search in various search behavior. These differences highlight the necessity of in-depth investigating user behavior in legal case retrieval and re-thinking the application of related mechanisms developed based on the user models in Web search. Then we investigated factors that would influence search behavior from different perspectives, including task difficulty and domain expertise. Finally, we shed light on implicit feedback in legal case retrieval and designed a predictive model for relevance based on user behavior. Our work provides a better understanding of user interactions in the legal case retrieval process, which can benefit the design of the corresponding retrieval systems to support legal practitioners.},

Ever since, diverse prophecies of computing have continually emerged, through to the present day.As computing spread beyond the US and UK, such prophecies emerged from strikingly different economic, political, and cultural conditions. This volume explores how these expectations differed, assesses unexpected commonalities, and suggests ways to understand the divergences and convergences.This book examines thirteen countries, based on source material in ten different languages—the effort of an international team of scholars.

abstract = {Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data, including web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents, and social media (such as blog articles, forum posts, product reviews, and tweets). This has led to an increasing demand for powerful software tools to help people manage and analyze vast amounts of text data effectively and efficiently. Unlike data generated by a computer system or sensors, text data are usually generated directly by humans, and capture semantically rich content. As such, text data are especially valuable for discovering knowledge about human opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. In contrast to structured data, which conform to well-defined schemas (thus are relatively easy for computers to handle), text has less explicit structure, requiring computer processing toward understanding of the content encoded in text. The current technology of natural language processing has not yet reached a point to enable a computer to precisely understand natural language text, but a wide range of statistical and heuristic approaches to management and analysis of text data have been developed over the past few decades. They are usually very robust and can be applied to analyze and manage text data in any natural language, and about any topic.This book provides a systematic introduction to many of these approaches, with an emphasis on covering the most useful knowledge and skills required to build a variety of practically useful text information systems. Because humans can understand natural languages far better than computers can, effective involvement of humans in a text information system is generally needed and text information systems often serve as intelligent assistants for humans. Depending on how a text information system collaborates with humans, we distinguish two kinds of text information systems. The first is information retrieval systems which include search engines and recommender systems; they assist users in finding from a large collection of text data the most relevant text data that are actually needed for solving a specific application problem, thus effecively turning big raw text data into much smaller relevant text data that can be more easily processed by humans. The second is text mining application systems; they can assist users in analyzing patterns in text data to extract and discover useful actionable knowledge directly useful for task completion or decision making, thus providing more direct task support for users. This book covers the major concepts, techniques, and ideas in information retrieval and text data mining from a practical viewpoint, and includes many hands-on exercises designed with a companion software toolkit (i.e., MeTA) to help readers learn how to apply techniques of information retrieval and text mining to real-world text data and how to experiment with and improve some of the algorithms for interesting application tasks. This book can be used as a textbook for computer science undergraduates and graduates, library and information scientists, or as a reference book for practitioners working on relevant problems in managing and analyzing text data.}

This series aims to highlight the accomplishments of awardees, explaining their major contributions of lasting importance in computing."Making Databases Work: The Pragmatic Wisdom of Michael Stonebraker," the first book in the series, celebrates Mike's contributions and impact. What accomplishments warranted computing's highest honor? How did Stonebraker do it? Who is Mike Stonebraker---researcher, professor, CTO, lecturer, innovative product developer, serial entrepreneur, and decades-long leader, and research evangelist for the database community. This book describes Mike's many contributions and evaluates them in light of the Turing Award.The book describes, in 36 chapters, the unique nature, significance, and impact of Mike's achievements in advancing modern database systems over more than 40 years. The stories involve technical concepts, projects, people, prototype systems, failures, lucky accidents, crazy risks, startups, products, venture capital, and lots of applications that drove Mike Stonebraker's achievements and career. Even if you have no interest in databases at all, you'll gain insights into the birth and evolution of Turing Award-worthy achievements from the perspectives of 39 remarkable computer scientists and professionals.Today, data is considered the world's most valuable resource ("The Economist," May 6, 2017), whether it is in the tens of millions of databases used to manage the world's businesses and governments, in the billions of databases in our smartphones and watches, or residing elsewhere, as yet unmanaged, awaiting the elusive next generation of database systems. Every one of the millions or billions of databases includes features that are celebrated by the 2014 A.M. Turing Award and are described in this book.}

abstract = {People write personalized greeting cards on various occasions. While prior work has studied gender roles in greeting card messages, systematic analysis at scale and tools for raising the awareness of gender stereotyping remain under-investigated. To this end, we collect a large greeting card message corpus covering three different occasions (birthday, Valentine’s Day and wedding) from three sources (exemplars from greeting message websites, real-life greetings from social media and language model generated ones). We uncover a wide range of gender stereotypes in this corpus via topic modeling, odds ratio and Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT). We further conduct a survey to understand people’s perception of gender roles in messages from this corpus and if gender stereotyping is a concern. The results show that people want to be aware of gender roles in the messages, but remain unconcerned unless the perceived gender roles conflict with the recipient’s true personality. In response, we developed GreetA, an interactive visualization and writing assistant tool to visualize fine-grained topics in greeting card messages drafted by the users and the associated gender perception scores, but without suggesting text changes as an intervention.},

A software similarity service provides benefit in identifying malware variants and families, discovering software theft, and revealing plagiarism of software programs. Simseer additionally performs code packing detection and automated unpacking of hidden code using application-level emulation. Finally, Simseer uses the similarity information from a sample set to identify program relationships and families through visualization of an evolutionary tree. 2) Bugwise is a service that identifies software bugs and defects. To achieve this end, it performs decompilation and data flow analysis. Bugwise can identify a subset of use-after-free bugs and has already found defects in Debian Linux. Bugwise and Simseer are both built on Malwise, a platform of binary analysis.},

In the blockchain-backed Web3 communities, known for their transparency and security, airdrop serves as a widespread incentive mechanism for allocating capital and power. However, it remains a controversy on how to justify airdrop to incentive and empower the decentralized governance. In this paper, we use ParaSwap as an example to propose a role taxonomy methodology through a data-driven study to understand the characteristic of community members and the effectiveness of airdrop. We find that users receive more rewards tend to take positive actions towards the community. We summarize several arbitrage patterns and confirm the current detection is not sufficient in screening out airdrop hunters. In conjunction with the results, we discuss from the aspects of interaction, financialization, and system design to conclude the challenges and possible research directions for decentralized communities.},

In this article, we make the case for social-minded measures, that is, measures that evaluate the effect of a system in society. We focus on three such measures, namely diversity (ensuring that all relevant aspects are represented), lack of bias (processing data without unjustifiable concentration on a particular side), and fairness (non discriminating treatment of data and people).},

We present MobiPurpose, a novel technique that can take a network request made by an Android app and then classify the data collection purposes, as one step towards making it possible to explain to non-experts the data disclosure contexts. Our purpose inference works by leveraging two observations: 1) developer naming conventions (e.g., URL paths) of ten offer hints as to data collection purposes, and 2) external knowledge, such as app metadata and information about the domain name, are meaningful cues that can be used to infer the behavior of different traffic requests. MobiPurpose parses each traffic request body into key-value pairs, and infers the data type and data collection purpose of each key-value pair using a combination of supervised learning and text pattern bootstrapping. We evaluated MobiPurpose's effectiveness using a dataset cross-labeled by ten human experts. Our results show that MobiPurpose can predict the data collection purpose with an average precision of 84% (among 19 unique categories).},

abstract = {With data revolution, data is emerging as a new raw material. As the importance of data has increased, interest in the availability of public sector information (PSI) has also grown. PSI created in the public sector comprises public attributes and directly impacts national administration and citizen's lives.Korea has almost the highest level of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure and considerable data through government-led policies. As a result of such policies, Korea has demonstrated excellent results in the United Nation's e-government survey, ITU's ICT development index, and OECD's public data openness index. Paradoxically, however, this history and experience is a stumbling block to a new era. PSI, which is a basic resource for realizing the value of openness, sharing, cooperation, and communication, should be actively managed and opened by government to provide support for reuse in the sense that the government is its main producer and manager. However, no matter how good the quality of PSI through data management is and how excellent policies and institutions are established, if the private sector cannot actively use it, it is useless. What is the role of government and law in the context of changing the way data is managed and blurring sectoral boundaries?This paper aims to propose core challenges by analyzing the case of Korea in order to derive a basis for discussions to coordinate public and private cooperation and legal relations in the process. To begin with, we analyze the changes in the management environment of data and PSI and identify the role of government and law in responding to changes in the legal rights. Then, we discuss how Korea responds to change, examines related policies by function and discussions on the data law, which seem to have the greatest effect on government's role, and suggests essential tasks to change its role accordingly.},

We juxtapose the design of computing that offers hope with that which offers only distraction, propose four modes to design for (being attentive, critical, different and in it together) and conclude with a plea to avoid tools that encourage a blinkered existence at a time of great uncertainty and change.},

abstract = {Due to the rapid growth of online video data, video-text retrieval techniques are in urgent need, which aim to search for the most relevant video given a natural language caption and vice versa. The major challenge of this task is how to identify the true fine-grained semantic correspondence between videos and texts, using only the document-level correspondence. To deal with this issue, we propose a simple yet effective two-stream framework which takes the concept information into account and introduces a new branch of semantic-level matching. We further propose a concept propagation mechanism for mining the latent semantics in videos and achieving enriched representations. The concept propagation is achieved by building a commonsense graph distilled from ConceptNet with concepts extracted from videos and captions. The original concepts of videos are detected by pretrained detectors as the initial concept representations. By conducting attentional graph reasoning on the commonsense graph with the guidance of external knowledge, we can extend some new concepts in a detector-free manner for further enriching the video representations. In addition, a propagated BCE loss is designed for supervising the concept propagation procedure. Common space learning is then constructed for cross-modal matching. We conduct extensive experiments on various baseline models and several benchmark datasets. Promising experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method.},

abstract = {Code Nation explores the rise of software development as a social, cultural, and technical phenomenon in American history. The movement germinated in government and university labs during the 1950s, gained momentum through corporate and counterculture experiments in the 1960s and 1970s, and became a broad-based computer literacy movement in the 1980s. As personal computing came to the fore, learning to program was transformed by a groundswell of popular enthusiasm, exciting new platforms, and an array of commercial practices that have been further amplified by distributed computing and the Internet. The resulting society can be depicted as a “Code Nation”—a globally-connected world that is saturated with computer technology and enchanted by software and its creation.Code Nation is a new history of personal computing that emphasizes the technical and business challenges that software developers faced when building applications for CP/M, MS-DOS, UNIX, Microsoft Windows, the Apple Macintosh, and other emerging platforms. It is a popular history of computing that explores the experiences of novice computer users, tinkerers, hackers, and power users, as well as the ideals and aspirations of leading computer scientists, engineers, educators, and entrepreneurs. Computer book and magazine publishers also played important, if overlooked, roles in the diffusion of new technical skills, and this book highlights their creative work and influence.Code Nation offers a “behind-the-scenes” look at application and operating-system programming practices, the diversity of historic computer languages, the rise of user communities, early attempts to market PC software, and the origins of “enterprise” computing systems. Code samples and over 80 historic photographs support the text. The book concludes with an assessment of contemporary efforts to teach computational thinking to young people.}

We show how to associate beliefs to model elements and how to propagate and operate with their associated uncertainty so that domain experts can individually reason about their models enriched with their personal opinions. In addition, we address the challenge of combining the opinions of different domain experts on the same model elements, with the goal to come up with informed collective decisions. We provide different strategies and a methodology to optimally merge individual opinions.},

abstract = {Tests that fail inconsistently, without changes to the code under test, are described as flaky. Flaky tests do not give a clear indication of the presence of software bugs and thus limit the reliability of the test suites that contain them. A recent survey of software developers found that 59% claimed to deal with flaky tests on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis. As well as being detrimental to developers, flaky tests have also been shown to limit the applicability of useful techniques in software testing research. In general, one can think of flaky tests as being a threat to the validity of any methodology that assumes the outcome of a test only depends on the source code it covers. In this article, we systematically survey the body of literature relevant to flaky test research, amounting to 76 papers. We split our analysis into four parts: addressing the causes of flaky tests, their costs and consequences, detection strategies, and approaches for their mitigation and repair. Our findings and their implications have consequences for how the software-testing community deals with test flakiness, pertinent to practitioners and of interest to those wanting to familiarize themselves with the research area.},

SIGCHI researchers have emphasized the need to understand human discretion at the street-level to be able to design human-centered algorithms for the public sector. In this study, we conducted computational text analysis of casenotes at a child-welfare agency in the midwestern United States and highlight patterns of invisible street-level discretionary work and latent power structures that have direct implications for algorithm design. Casenotes offer a unique lens for policymakers and CW leadership towards understanding the experiences of on-the-ground caseworkers. As a result of this study, we highlight how street-level discretionary work needs to be supported by sociotechnical systems developed through worker-centered design. This study offers the first computational inspection of casenotes and introduces them to the SIGCHI community as a critical data source for studying complex sociotechnical systems.},

Today public key cryptography provides the primary basis for secure communication over the internet, enabling online work, socializing, shopping, government services, and much more.While other books have documented the development of public key cryptography, this is the first to provide a comprehensive insiders’ perspective on the full impacts of public key cryptography, including six original chapters by nine distinguished scholars. The book begins with an original joint biography of the lives and careers of Diffie and Hellman, highlighting parallels and intersections, and contextualizing their work. Subsequent chapters show how public key cryptography helped establish an open cryptography community and made lasting impacts on computer and network security, theoretical computer science, mathematics, public policy, and society. The volume includes particularly influential articles by Diffie and Hellman, as well as newly transcribed interviews and Turing Award Lectures by both Diffie and Hellman.The contributed chapters provide new insights that are accessible to a wide range of readers, from computer science students and computer security professionals, to historians of technology and members of the general public. The chapters can be readily integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses on a range of topics, including computer security, theoretical computer science and mathematics, the history of computing, and science and technology policy.}

abstract = {The field of multimedia is unique in offering a rich and dynamic forum for researchers from "traditional" fields to collaborate and develop new solutions and knowledge that transcend the boundaries of individual disciplines. Despite the prolific research activities and outcomes, however, few efforts have been made to develop books that serve as an introduction to the rich spectrum of topics covered by this broad field. A few books are available that either focus on specific subfields or basic background in multimedia. Tutorial-style materials covering the active topics being pursued by the leading researchers at frontiers of the field are currently lacking. In 2015, ACM SIGMM, the special interest group on multimedia, launched a new initiative to address this void by selecting and inviting 12 rising-star speakers from different subfields of multimedia research to deliver plenary tutorial-style talks at the ACM Multimedia conference for 2015. Each speaker discussed the challenges and state-of-the-art developments of their prospective research areas in a general manner to the broad community. The covered topics were comprehensive, including multimedia content understanding, multimodal human-human and human-computer interaction, multimedia social media, and multimedia system architecture and deployment.  Following the very positive responses to these talks, the speakers were invited to expand the content covered in their talks into chapters that can be used as reference material for researchers, students, and practitioners. Each chapter discusses the problems, technical challenges, state-of-the-art approaches and performances, open issues, and promising direction for future work. Collectively, the chapters provide an excellent sampling of major topics addressed by the community as a whole. This book, capturing some of the outcomes of such efforts, is well positioned to fill the aforementioned needs in providing tutorial-style reference materials for frontier topics in multimedia.}

abstract = {“Communities of Computing” is the first book-length history of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), founded in 1947 and with a membership today of 100,000 worldwide. It profiles ACM's notable SIGs, active chapters, and individual members, setting ACM's history into a rich social and political context. The book's 12 core chapters are organized into three thematic sections. “Defining the Discipline” examines the 1960s and 1970s when the field of computer science was taking form at the National Science Foundation, Stanford University, and through ACM's notable efforts in education and curriculum standards.  “Broadening the Profession” looks outward into the wider society as ACM engaged with social and political issues-and as members struggled with balancing a focus on scientific issues and awareness of the wider world. Chapters examine the social turbulence surrounding the Vietnam War, debates about the women's movement, efforts for computing and community education, and international issues including professionalization and the Cold War.  “Expanding Research Frontiers” profiles three areas of research activity where ACM members and ACM itself shaped notable advances in computing, including computer graphics, computer security, and hypertext.  Featuring insightful profiles of notable ACM leaders, such as Edmund Berkeley, George Forsythe, Jean Sammet, Peter Denning, and Kelly Gotlieb, and honest assessments of controversial episodes, the volume deals with compelling and complex issues involving ACM and computing. It is not a narrow organizational history of ACM committees and SIGs, although much information about them is given. All chapters are original works of research. Many chapters draw on archival records of ACM's headquarters, ACM SIGs, and ACM leaders. This volume makes a permanent contribution to documenting the history of ACM and understanding its central role in the history of computing.}

abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have developed contact tracing technologies to curb the spread of the disease by locating and isolating people who have been in contact with coronavirus carriers. Subsequently, understanding why people install and use contact tracing applications is becoming central to their effectiveness and impact. However, involuntary systems can crowd out the use of voluntary applications when several contact tracing initiatives are employed simultaneously. To investigate this hypothesis, we analyze the concurrent deployment of two contact tracing technologies in Israel: centralized mass surveillance technologies and a voluntary contact tracing mobile app. Based on a representative survey of Israelis (n=519), our findings show that positive attitudes toward mass surveillance were related to a reduced likelihood of installing contact tracing apps and an increased likelihood of uninstalling them. These results also hold when controlling for privacy concerns, attitudes toward the app, trust in authorities, and demographic properties. We conclude the paper by suggesting a broader framework for analyzing crowding out effects in ecosystems that combine involuntary surveillance and voluntary participation.},

abstract = {Distributed ledger technology, frequently designated as 'blockchain,' is evolving from its hype phase toward greater maturity and long-term value creation. Although many academic communities were initially slow to grasp the technology's numerous potential implications, meanwhile a substantial amount of research is dedicated to investigating the development and impact of blockchain and related technologies. As undertaken, most research projects take a specific homogenous perspective, such as a technical or business viewpoint. To date, blockchain research studies are largely missing a bridge between and across academic disciplines. Given the manifold implications of blockchain technology, a fruitful crossdisciplinary exchange is therefore needed. In this paper, we bring together researchers with varying expertise to provide a vision into what may be next in terms of concepts, applications, and research agendas. We consider business, economic, societal, legal, technical, and philosophical viewpoints and propose multiple research questions as well as hypotheses arising from these diverse viewpoints. Simultaneously, we challenge various academic communities to tackle some of the most crucial issues of current blockchain research and to develop a solid foundation for future exploration.},

Alongside the entertainment of social interaction, we are experiencing tremendous visual violation and photo abusing. Especially, users may be unconsciously filmed and exposed online, which is termed as the non-consensual sharing issue. Unfortunately, this problem cannot be well handled with proactive access control or dedicated bystander detection, as users are unaware of their situations and may be filmed stealthily. We propose Videre on behalf of the privacy of the unaware parties in a way that they would be automatically identified and warned before such photos go public. For this, we first elaborate on the predominant features encountered in non-consensual captured photos via a thorough user study. Then we establish a dataset for this context and build a classifier as a proactive detector based on multi-deep-feature fusion. To relieve the burden of person-wise unawareness detection, we further design a signature-based filter for local pre-authorization, which can also implicitly avoid classification errors. We implement and test Videre in various field settings to demonstrate its effectiveness and performance.},

Drawing on a mix of archival materials, participant observation, and interviews within and beyond the city of Seattle, Washington, we look at the motivations of public restroom facilities managers as they introduce (or consider introducing) networked technology in the spaces they administer. Over the course of the research, we found internet of things technologies-or, connected devices imbued with computational capacity-became increasingly tied up with cost-reducing efficiencies and exploitative regulatory techniques. Drawing from this case study, we develop the concept of managerial visions: ways of seeing that structure labor, enforce compliance, and define access to resources. We argue that these ways of seeing prove increasingly critical to HCI research as it attends to computer-mediated collaboration beyond white-collar settings.},

Over the course of the research, we found workers engaged in continuous acts of calibration, troubleshooting, and repair required to support AI technologies over time. In interrogating these sites, we develop the concept of "patchwork": human labor that occurs in the space between what AI purports to do and what it actually accomplishes. We argue that it is necessary to consider the often-undervalued frontline work that makes up for AI's shortcomings during implementation, particularly as CSCW increasingly turns to discussions of Human-AI collaboration.},

In this article, we explore an additional contributor to workers’ limited temporal flexibility: the design of crowdsourcing platforms, namely requiring crowdworkers to be ‘on call’ for work. We conducted two studies to investigate the impact of having to be ‘on call’ on workers’ schedule control and job control. We find that being ‘on call’ impacted (1) participants’ ability to schedule their time and stick to planned work hours, and (2) the pace at which participants worked and took breaks. The results of the two studies suggest that the ‘on-demand’ nature of crowdsourcing platforms can limit workers’ temporal flexibility by reducing schedule control and job control. We conclude the article by discussing the implications of the results for (a)&nbsp;crowdworkers, (b) crowdsourcing platforms, and (c) the wider platform economy.},

We present the system design through iterative evaluations with qualitative researchers. We show how queries become a part of the inductive process, enabling researchers to try multiple ideas while gaining intuition and discovering less-obvious insights. We discuss the choice of LJ as a rich source of public posts, the preference for GN embeddings which link formal language (e.g. "reminiscence triggers") with colloquial expressions (e.g. "music brings back memories"), the interplay between tool and user, and potential qualitative and social research opportunities.},

An “interaction technique” starts when the user performs an action that causes an electronic device to respond, and includes the direct feedback from the device to the user. Examples include physical buttons and switches, on-screen menus and scrollbars operated by a mouse, touchscreen widgets, gestures such as flick-to-scroll, text entry on computers and touchscreens, input for virtual reality systems, interactions with conversational agents such as Apple Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Microsoft Cortana, and adaptations of all of these for people with disabilities. Pick, Click, Flick! is written for anyone interested in interaction techniques, including computer scientists and designers working on human-computer interaction, as well as implementers and consumers who want to understand and get the most out of their digital devices.REVIEWS“Pick, Click, Flick! is an impressive reference manual of the many years of interaction design development. It is a reference book, invaluable when questions arise, whether while you are busy designing something, or learning, or teaching, where assigning sections of the reference will be a valuable resource and learning tool for students. Brad Myers has provided a great service to the interaction community.” ‐ Don Norman, Distinguished Prof. Emeritus, Design Lab, University of California, San Diego“Every UX professional should immerse themselves in this book. Not only does it unravel the fascinating and complex history of GUI widgets that will captivate any user interface nerd, but it also stands as the definitive guide to an incredibly diverse array of interaction techniques. This is not just an engaging read; it’s an essential toolkit.” ‐ Jakob Nielsen, Principal, Nielsen Design Group}

From the perspective of human analysts and policy makers, forecasting algorithms must not only make accurate predictions but must also provide supporting evidence, e.g., the causal factors related to the event of interest. We develop a novel multiple instance learning based approach that jointly tackles the problem of identifying evidence-based precursors and forecasts events into the future. Specifically, given a collection of streaming news articles from multiple sources we develop a nested multiple instance learning approach to forecast significant societal events such as protests. Using data from three countries in Latin America, we demonstrate how our approach is able to consistently identify news articles considered as precursors for protests. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the strengths of our proposed approach in filtering candidate precursors, in forecasting the occurrence of events with a lead time advantage and in accurately predicting the characteristics of civil unrest events.},

One can use blockchain technology with decentralised storage of data, which is distributed, immutable, tamper resistance, and securable with a consensus mechanism. Today, many government sectors, organisations, companies, and institutions follow blockchain technology using smart contracts that do not require third-party agreements. We have conducted a systematic survey on blockchain-based digital certification to find the research gap in this research work.

abstract = {Power exercised by large technology companies has led to concerns over privacy and data protection, evidenced by the passage of legislation including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). While much privacy research has focused on how users perceive privacy and interact with companies, we focus on how privacy legislation is discussed among a different set of relationships-those between companies and investors. This paper investigates how companies translate the GDPR and CCPA into business risks in documents created for investors. We conduct a qualitative document analysis of annual regulatory filings (Form 10-K) from nine major technology companies. We outline five ways that technology companies consider GDPR and CCPA as business risks, describing both direct and indirect ways that the legislation may affect their businesses. We highlight how these findings are relevant for the broader CSCW and privacy research communities in research, design, and practice. Creating meaningful privacy changes within existing institutional structures requires some understanding of the dynamics of these companies' decision-making processes and the role of capital.},

While prior research has introduced algorithms and systems to address these impairments, they predominantly cater to specific tasks or environments and fail to accommodate the diverse and dynamic nature of SIIDs. We introduce Human I/O, a unified approach to detecting a wide range of SIIDs by gauging the availability of human input/output channels. Leveraging egocentric vision, multimodal sensing and reasoning with large language models, Human I/O achieves a 0.22 mean absolute error and a 82% accuracy in availability prediction across 60 in-the-wild egocentric video recordings in 32 different scenarios. Furthermore, while the core focus of our work is on the detection of SIIDs rather than the creation of adaptive user interfaces, we showcase the efficacy of our prototype via a user study with 10 participants. Findings suggest that Human I/O significantly reduces effort and improves user experience in the presence of SIIDs, paving the way for more adaptive and accessible interactive systems in the future.},

abstract = {Researchers have recognized the importance of utilizing temporal features for improving the performance of information retrieval systems. Specifically, the timeliness of a web document can be a significant factor for determining whether it is relevant for a search query. Previous works have proposed time-aware retrieval models with particular focus on news queries, where recent web documents related with a real-world event are generally preferable. These queries typically exhibit bursts in the volume of published documents or submitted queries. However, no work has studied the role of time in queries such as "credit card overdraft fees" that have no major spikes in either document or query volumes over time, yet they still favor more recently published documents. In this work, we focus on this class of queries that we refer to as "timely queries". We show that the change in the terms distribution of results of timely queries over time is strongly correlated with the users' perception of time sensitivity. Based on this observation, we propose a method to estimate the query timeliness requirements and we propose principled ways to incorporate document freshness into the ranking model. Our study shows that our method yields a more accurate estimation of timeliness compared to volume-based approaches. We experimentally compare our ranking strategy with other time-sensitive and non time-sensitive ranking algorithms and we show that it improves the results' retrieval quality for timely queries.},

abstract = {Topic modeling provides a powerful way to analyze the content of a collection of documents. It has become a popular tool in many research areas, such as text mining, information retrieval, natural language processing, and other related fields. In real-world applications, however, the usefulness of topic modeling is limited due to scalability issues. Scaling to larger document collections via parallelization is an active area of research, but most solutions require drastic steps, such as vastly reducing input vocabulary. In this article we introduce Regularized Latent Semantic Indexing (RLSI)---including a batch version and an online version, referred to as batch RLSI and online RLSI, respectively---to scale up topic modeling. Batch RLSI and online RLSI are as effective as existing topic modeling techniques and can scale to larger datasets without reducing input vocabulary. Moreover, online RLSI can be applied to stream data and can capture the dynamic evolution of topics. Both versions of RLSI formalize topic modeling as a problem of minimizing a quadratic loss function regularized by ℓ1 and/or ℓ2 norm. This formulation allows the learning process to be decomposed into multiple suboptimization problems which can be optimized in parallel, for example, via MapReduce. We particularly propose adopting ℓ1 norm on topics and ℓ2 norm on document representations to create a model with compact and readable topics and which is useful for retrieval. In learning, batch RLSI processes all the documents in the collection as a whole, while online RLSI processes the documents in the collection one by one. We also prove the convergence of the learning of online RLSI. Relevance ranking experiments on three TREC datasets show that batch RLSI and online RLSI perform better than LSI, PLSI, LDA, and NMF, and the improvements are sometimes statistically significant. Experiments on a Web dataset containing about 1.6 million documents and 7 million terms, demonstrate a similar boost in performance.},

abstract = {As recently as 1968, computer scientists were uncertain how best to interconnect even two computers. The notion that within a few decades the challenge would be how to interconnect millions of computers around the globe was too far-fetched to contemplate. Yet, by 1988, that is precisely what was happening. The products and devices developed in the intervening years—such as modems, multiplexers, local area networks, and routers—became the linchpins of the global digital society. How did such revolutionary innovation occur? This book tells the story of the entrepreneurs who were able to harness and join two factors: the energy of computer science researchers supported by governments and universities, and the tremendous commercial demand for Internetworking computers. The centerpiece of this history comes from unpublished interviews from the late 1980s with over 80 computing industry pioneers, including Paul Baran, J.C.R. Licklider, Vint Cerf, Robert Kahn, Larry Roberts, and Robert Metcalfe. These individuals give us unique insights into the creation of multi-billion dollar markets for computer-communications equipment, and they reveal how entrepreneurs struggled with failure, uncertainty, and the limits of knowledge.“The key technologies that brought us our modern networked society—routers, packet switching, multiplexers, Internet protocols—were all invented by people in the short period between 1968 and 1988. James Pelkey interviewed these people at that time and recorded their stories. This book is the result: a detailed and up-close personal history of a world being born. Fascinating.” - W. Brian Arthur, Author of The Nature of Technology: What It Is and How It Evolves“Circuits, Packets, and Protocols is full of revelations for me even though I was there. Never had it explained so clearly how my distributed computing strategy was the wrong one for 3Com in the 1980s.” - Bob Metcalfe, Internet Pioneer, Ethernet inventor, 3Com founder; University of Texas at Austin Professor of Innovation}

Conventional ledger databases mostly rely on authenticated structures such as the Merkle tree and transparency logs for supporting auditability, and hence they suffer from the performance problem. As opposed to conventional ledger DBMSes, we design VeDB - a high-performance verifiable software (Ve-S) and hardware (Ve-H) enabled DBMS with rigorous auditability for better user options and broad applications. In Ve-S, we devise a novel verifiable Shrubs array (VSA) with two-layer ordinals (serial numbers) which outperforms conventional Merkle tree-based models due to lower CPU and I/O cost. It enables rigorous auditability through its efficient credible timestamp range authentication method, and fine-grained data verification at the client side, which are lacking in state-of-the-art relational ledger databases. In Ve-H, we devise a non-intrusive trusted affiliation by TEE leveraging digest signing, monotonic counters, and trusted timestamps in VeDB, which supports both data notarization and lineage applications. The experimental results show that VeDB-VSA outperforms Merkle tree-based authenticated data structures (ADS) up to 70\texttimes{} and 3.7\texttimes{} for insertion and verification; and VeDB Ve-H data lineage verification is 8.5\texttimes{} faster than Ve-S.},

However, little is known about the actual use of such community-sourced risk systems from the perspective of both community members and the safety departments. This study is the first large-scale empirical analysis of community-sourced risk systems. More specifically, we conducted a comprehensive system log analysis of LiveSafe--a community-sourced risk system--that has been used by more than two hundred universities and colleges. Our findings revealed a mismatch between what the safety departments expected to receive and what their community members actually reported, and identified several factors (e.g., anonymity, organization, and tip type) that were associated with the safety departments' responses to their members' tips. Our findings provide design implications for chatbot-enabled community-risk systems and make practical contributions for safety organizations and practitioners to improve community engagement.},

A cryptographic scheme is constructed so as to maintain a desired functionality, even under malicious attempts aimed at making it deviate from its prescribed behavior. The design of cryptographic systems must be based on firm foundations, whereas ad hoc approaches and heuristics are a very dangerous way to go. These foundations were developed mostly in the 1980s, in works that are all co-authored by Shafi Goldwasser and/or Silvio Micali. These works have transformed cryptography from an engineering discipline, lacking sound theoretical foundations, into a scientific field possessing a well-founded theory, which influences practice as well as contributes to other areas of theoretical computer science.This book celebrates these works, which were the basis for bestowing the 2012 A.M. Turing Award upon Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali. A significant portion of this book reproduces some of these works, and another portion consists of scientific perspectives by some of their former students.

Consequently, user quality of experience (QoE) suffers inevitably when network conditions become unfavorable. We present a new video delivery framework that utilizes client computation and recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) to reduce the dependency for delivering high-quality video. The use of DNNs enables us to enhance the video quality independent to the available bandwidth. We design a practical system that addresses several challenges, such as client heterogeneity, interaction with bitrate adaptation, and DNN transfer, in enabling the idea. Our evaluation using 3G and broadband network traces shows the proposed system outperforms the current state of the art, enhancing the average QoE by 43.08% using the same bandwidth budget or saving 17.13% of bandwidth while providing the same user QoE.},

volume = {7},
abstract = {From the Preface Ada's Legacy illustrates the depth and diversity of writers, thinkers, and makers who have been inspired by Ada Lovelace, the English mathematician and writer. The volume, which commemorates the bicentennial of Ada's birth in December 1815, celebrates Lovelace's many achievements as well as the impact of her life and work, which reverberated widely since the late 19th century. In the 21st century we have seen a resurgence in Lovelace scholarship, thanks to the growth of interdisciplinary thinking and the expanding influence of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Ada's Legacy is a unique contribution to this scholarship. Here, the editors present work on topics previously unknown to coexist in print: Ada's collaboration with Charles Babbage, the development of the Ada programming language, Ada's position in the Victorian and Steampunk literary genres, Ada's representation in and inspiration of contemporary art and comics, and Ada's continued relevance in discussions around gender and technology in the digital age. With the 200th anniversary of Ada Lovelace's birth on December 10, 2015, we believe that the timing is perfect to publish this collection. Because of its broad focus on subjects that reach far beyond the life and work of Ada herself, Ada's Legacy will appeal to readers who are curious about Ada's enduring importance in computing and the wider world.  The idea for this book originated from the first academic conference of its kind, Ada Lovelace: An Interdisciplinary Conference Celebrating her Achievements and Legacy, which took place at Stevens Institute of Technology (Hoboken, New Jersey) on October 18, 2013, under the auspices of the Institute's College of Arts and Letters. The time was definitely right to bring this conference to Stevens, which was until 1971 a male-only school. By 1982, Stevens became the first major institute in the United States to implement a personal computer requirement for its students. Around this time, a pioneering technology project resulted in the networking of the entire Stevens campus, creating one of the nation's first intranets. Additionally, the recent development of undergraduate programs in the College of Arts and Letters, including Gender Studies as well as Science and Technology Studies, which strongly anchors women in STEM, clearly made Stevens well positioned to host a conference celebrating Lovelace's achievements and legacy. The conference brought together international scholars from across the disciplines to coincide with the week celebrating Ada Lovelace Day. Tremendous interest circulated in advance of the conference, particularly among computing history specialists and 19th-century literary scholars, and it escalated immediately following the proceedings. Tom Misa, director of the Charles Babbage Institute and a featured speaker at the conference, numbered chiefly among those who caught this interest. He envisioned the possibility for a book project to develop concrete examination of ideas inspired by the proceedings. The conference organizer, Robin Hammerman, and Andrew Russell, director of the College of Arts and Letters Science and Technology Studies program, enthusiastically agreed to collaborate as editors for this interdisciplinary collection.  Many of the papers published in this volume first were presented at the conference in October 2013. We are pleased to acknowledge the supporters of that conference: Dr. Lisa Dolling, former Dean of the College of Arts &amp; Letters at Stevens Institute of Technology, and Dr. George Korfiatis, Provost of Stevens Institute of Technology.  The editors are grateful to Thomas J. Misa, Series Editor for ACM's History of Computing, for skillfully overseeing the development of this project from its inception to completion. We also are happy to thank Diane Cerra, Executive Editor at Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers, for her kind and capable attention to the production of this volume. And we are delighted that Sydney Padua graciously agreed to create original illustrations for Ada's Legacy.}

abstract = {Professor Stephen A. Cook is a pioneer of the theory of computational complexity. His work on NP-completeness and the P vs. NP problem remains a central focus of this field. Cook won the 1982 Turing Award for “his advancement of our understanding of the complexity of computation in a significant and profound way.” This volume includes a selection of seminal papers embodying the work that led to this award, exemplifying Cook’s synthesis of ideas and techniques from logic and the theory of computation including NP-completeness, proof complexity, bounded arithmetic, and parallel and space-bounded computation. These papers are accompanied by contributed articles by leading researchers in these areas, which convey to a general reader the importance of Cook’s ideas and their enduring impact on the research community. The book also contains biographical material, Cook’s Turing Award lecture, and an interview. Together these provide a portrait of Cook as a recognized leader and innovator in mathematics and computer science, as well as a gentle mentor and colleague.}

abstract = {Trends are those keywords, phrases, or names that are mentioned most often on social media or in news in a particular timeframe.They are an effective way for human news readers to both discover and stay focused on the most relevant information of the day. In this work, we consider trends that correspond to an entity in a knowledge graph and introduce the new and as-yet unexplored task of identifying other entities that may help explain the "why" an entity is trending. We refer to these retrieved entities as contextual entities. Some of them are more important than others in the context of the trending entity and we thus determine a ranking of entities according to how useful they are in contextualizing the trend.We propose two solutions for ranking contextual entities. The first one is fully unsupervised and based on Personalized PageRank, calculated over a trending entity-specific graph of other entities where the edges encode a notion of directional similarity based on embedded background knowledge. Our second method is based on learning to rank and combines the intuitions behind the unsupervised model with signals derived from hand-crafted features in a supervised setting. We compare our models on this novel task by using a new, purpose-built test collection created using crowdsourcing. Our methods improve over the strongest baseline in terms ofPrecision at 1 by 7% (unsupervised) and 13% (supervised). We find that the salience of a contextual entity and how coherent it is with respect to the news story are strong indicators of relevance in both unsupervised and supervised settings.},

We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference.CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors.As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous "revise and resubmit" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels.Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on "Conversational AI &amp; Lessons Learned." Our closing plenary will feature Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, "The Science Gap." We also welcome Paul Luff and Christian Heath from King's College as the recipients of this year's CSCW Lasting Impact award for their influential 1998 paper, "Mobility in Collaboration."},

Video broadcasting and online video platforms make watching basketball games increasingly accessible. Yet, for new or casual fans, watching basketball videos is often confusing due to their limited basketball knowledge and the lack of accessible, on-demand information to resolve their confusion. To assist casual fans in watching basketball videos, we compared the game-watching behaviors of casual and die-hard fans in a formative study and developed iBall based on the findings. iBall embeds visualizations into basketball videos using a computer vision pipeline, and automatically adapts the visualizations based on the game context and users’ gaze, helping casual fans appreciate basketball games without being overwhelmed. We confirmed the usefulness, usability, and engagement of iBall in a study with 16 casual fans, and further collected feedback from 8 die-hard fans.},

In this paper, I identify the sociotechnical futures that Amazon-one of the big tech companies-envisions and the future of work that the company is moving toward. I explore the future of fulfillment centers through an analysis of the patents on fulfillment center technologies which Amazon may turn into reality one day. In my analysis, I focus on humans by asking how they are configured in the future of fulfillment centers and, more specifically, how Amazon envisions the role of human labor within work automation and AI systems. The analysis reveals where and how humans are expected to "step in" to operate the future of fulfillment centers. I discuss my findings within and beyond CSCW, highlighting the importance of studying tech companies' imaginaries. I argue that by understanding tech companies' imaginaries, it becomes possible for us to launch effective sociotechnical interventions to negotiate or even resist their specific imaginaries and/or design ways for a more democratic uptake of companies' future technologies. Finally, I articulate practical ways in which patents can be utilized in CSCW research.},

abstract = {Social media users may wish to delete their accounts, but it is unclear if this process is easy to complete or if users understand what happens to their account data after deletion. Furthermore, since platforms profit from users' data and activity, they have incentives to maintain active users, possibly affecting what account deletion options are offered. To investigate these issues, we conducted a two-part study. In Study Part 1, we created and deleted accounts on the top 20 social media platforms in the United States and performed an analysis of 490 deletion-related screens across these platforms. In Study Part 2, informed by our interface analysis, we surveyed 200 social media users to understand how users perceive and experience social media account deletion. From these studies, we have four main findings. First, account deletion options vary considerably across platforms and the language used to describe these options is not always clear. Most platforms offer account deletion on desktop browsers but not all allow account deletion from mobile apps or browsers. Second, we found evidence of several dark patterns present in the account deletion interfaces and platform policies. Third, most participants had tried to delete at least one social media account, yet over one-third of deletion attempts were never completed. Fourth, users mostly agreed that they did not want platforms to have access to deleted account data. Based on these results, we recommend that platforms improve the terminology used in account deletion interfaces so the outcomes of account deletion are more clear to users. Additionally, we recommend that platforms allow users to delete their social media accounts from any device they use to access the platform. Finally, future work is needed to assess how users are affected by account deletion related dark patterns.},

In both of these scenarios, regular human coaching has benefits, but in practice, the required training is often carried out alone, resulting in lowered adherence. This work presents a mixed methodology approach, novel in the context of designing for HRI, towards informing the design of a personalised robotic coach for stroke rehabilitation and squash. Using observations of human-human interactions, we first obtained action sequences of behaviours exhibited by coaches and physiotherapists. We then clustered these action sequences into behaviour graphs, with each graph representing a coaching policy usable for robotic control. Next we obtained coaches’ and physiotherapists’ reflections on the graphs’ applicability to the real world. Finally, we provide an explanation of how the policies visualised in these graphs could be used for robotic control.},

Arguably this is especially true for cross-disciplinary fields like HCI, where relatively fragmented specialisms co-exist. With COVID-19 and its negative impacts on ECRs as the backdrop, we explored the design of a 5-month virtual training program for ECRs worldwide (with particular emphasis on the Global South). Through an action research approach, the program was executed in collaboration with the organizers of a cross-disciplinary conference. Eighty-one participants from 26 countries took part. The program created a collaborative learning experience for attendees and provided opportunities for networking and learning the nuances of the peer-review process. This article details our experiences and provides reflections on design opportunities to (1) develop professional development spaces for underserved researchers, and (2) leverage ECRs’ unique capacity for contributing to inclusive conference spaces.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, wearable activity trackers (WATs) have become increasingly popular. However, despite many research studies in different fields (e.g. psychology, health, and design), few have sought to jointly examine the critical aspects of utility (i.e., benefits brought by these devices), privacy, and security (i.e., risks and vulnerabilities associated with them). To fill this gap, we reviewed 236 studies that researched the benefits of using WATs, the implications for the privacy of users of WATs, and the security vulnerabilities of these devices. Our survey revealed that these devices expose users to several threats. For example, WAT data can be mined to infer private information, such as the personality traits of the user. Whereas many works propose empirical findings about users’ privacy perceptions and their behaviors in relation to privacy, we found relatively few studies researching technologies to better protect users’ privacy with these devices. This survey contributes to systematizing knowledge on the utility, privacy, and security of WATs, shedding light on the state-of-the-art approaches with these devices, and discussing open research opportunities.},

abstract = {Genome sequencing technology has advanced at a rapid pace and it is now possible to generate highly-detailed genotypes inexpensively. The collection and analysis of such data has the potential to support various applications, including personalized medical services. While the benefits of the genomics revolution are trumpeted by the biomedical community, the increased availability of such data has major implications for personal privacy; notably because the genome has certain essential features, which include (but are not limited to) (i) an association with traits and certain diseases, (ii) identification capability (e.g., forensics), and (iii) revelation of family relationships. Moreover, direct-to-consumer DNA testing increases the likelihood that genome data will be made available in less regulated environments, such as the Internet and for-profit companies. The problem of genome data privacy thus resides at the crossroads of computer science, medicine, and public policy. While the computer scientists have addressed data privacy for various data types, there has been less attention dedicated to genomic data. Thus, the goal of this paper is to provide a systematization of knowledge for the computer science community. In doing so, we address some of the (sometimes erroneous) beliefs of this field and we report on a survey we conducted about genome data privacy with biomedical specialists. Then, after characterizing the genome privacy problem, we review the state-of-the-art regarding privacy attacks on genomic data and strategies for mitigating such attacks, as well as contextualizing these attacks from the perspective of medicine and public policy. This paper concludes with an enumeration of the challenges for genome data privacy and presents a framework to systematize the analysis of threats and the design of countermeasures as the field moves forward.},

abstract = {Result diversification is an important aspect in web-based search, document summarization, facility location, portfolio management, and other applications. Given a set of ranked results for a set of objects (e.g., web documents, facilities, etc.) with a distance between any pair, the goal is to select a subset S satisfying the following three criteria: (a) the subset S satisfies some constraint (e.g., bounded cardinality), (b) the subset contains results of high “quality,” and (c) the subset contains results that are “diverse” relative to the distance measure. The goal of result diversification is to produce a diversified subset while maintaining high quality as much as possible. We study a broad class of problems where the distances are a metric, where the constraint is given by independence in a matroid, where quality is determined by a monotone submodular function and diversity is defined as the sum of distances between objects in S. Our problem is a generalization of the max-sum diversification problem studied in Gollapudi and Sharma [2009], which in turn is a generalization of the max-sum p-dispersion problem studied extensively in location theory. It is NP-hard even with the triangle inequality. We propose two simple and natural algorithms: a greedy algorithm for a cardinality constraint and a local search algorithm for an arbitrary matroid constraint. We prove that both algorithms achieve constant approximation ratios.},

abstract = {Botnets account for a substantial portion of cybercrime. Botmasters utilize darkweb marketplaces to promote and provide their services, which can vary from renting or buying a botnet (or parts of it) to hiring services (e.g., distributed denial of service attacks). At the same time, botnet takedown attempts have proven to be challenging, demanding a combination of technical and legal methods, and often requiring the collaboration of a plethora of entities with varying jurisdictions. In this article, we map the elements associated with the business aspect of botnets and utilize them to develop adaptations of two widely used business models. Furthermore, we analyze the 28 most notable botnet takedown operations carried out from 2008 to 2021, in regard to the methods employed, and illustrate the correlation between these methods and the segments of our adapted business models. Our analysis suggests that the botnet takedown methods have been mainly focused on the technical side, but not on the botnet economic components. We aim to shed light on new takedown vectors and incentivize takedown actors to expand their efforts to methods oriented more toward the business side of botnets, which could contribute toward eliminating some of the challenges that surround takedown operations.},

abstract = {To support efficient, balanced news consumption, merging articles from diverse sources into one, potentially through crowdsourcing, could alleviate some hurdles. However, the merging process could also impact annotators’ attitudes towards the content. To test this theory, we propose comparative news annotation; that is, annotating similarities and differences between a pair of articles. By developing and deploying NewsComp—a prototype system—we conducted a between-subjects experiment (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;109) to examine how users’ annotations compare to experts’, and how comparative annotation affects users’ perceptions of article credibility and quality. We found that comparative annotation can marginally impact users’ credibility perceptions in certain cases; it did not impact perceptions of quality. While users’ annotations were not on par with experts’, they showed greater precision in finding similarities than in identifying disparate important statements. The comparison process also led users to notice differences in information placement and depth, degree of factuality/opinion, and empathetic/inflammatory language use. We discuss implications for the design of future comparative annotation tasks.},

abstract = {Adolescent peer relationships, essential for their development, are increasingly mediated by digital technologies. As this trend continues, wearable devices, especially smartwatches tailored for adolescents, is reshaping their socialization. In China, smartwatches like XTC have gained wide popularity, introducing unique features such as “Bump-to-Connect” and exclusive social platforms. Nonetheless, how these devices influence adolescents’ peer experience remains unknown. Addressing this, we interviewed 18 Chinese adolescents (age: 11—16), discovering a smartwatch-mediated social ecosystem. Our findings highlight the ice-breaking role of smartwatches in friendship initiation and their use for secret messaging with local peers. Within the online smartwatch community, peer status is determined by likes and visibility, leading to diverse pursuit activities (i.e., chu guanxi, jiazu, kuolie) and negative social dynamics. We discuss the core affordances of smartwatches and Chinese cultural factors that influence adolescent social behavior, and offer implications for designing future wearables that responsibly and safely support adolescent socialization.},

In this work I review different approaches to moderation research with the goal of providing a roadmap for researchers studying community self-moderation. I contrast community-based moderation research with platforms and policies-focused moderation research, and argue that the former has an important role to play in shaping discussions about the future of online moderation. I provide six guiding questions for future research that, if answered, can support the development of a form of user-driven moderation that is widely implementable across a variety of social spaces online, offering an alternative to the corporate moderation models that dominate public debate and discussion.},

abstract = {TLS is an end-to-end protocol designed to provide confidentiality and integrity guarantees that improve end-user security and privacy. While TLS helps defend against pervasive surveillance of intercepted unencrypted traffic, it also hinders several common beneficial operations typically performed by middleboxes on the network traffic. Consequently, various methods have been proposed that “bypass” the confidentiality goals of TLS by playing with keys and certificates essentially in a man-in-the-middle solution, as well as new proposals that extend the protocol to accommodate third parties, delegation schemes to trusted middleboxes, and fine-grained control and verification mechanisms. We first review the use cases expecting plain HTTP traffic and discuss the extent to which TLS hinders these operations. We retain 19 scenarios where access to unencrypted traffic is still relevant and evaluate the incentives of the stakeholders involved. Second, we survey 30 schemes by which TLS no longer delivers end-to-end security and by which the notion of an “end” changes, including caching middleboxes such as Content Delivery Networks. Finally, we compare each scheme based on deployability and security characteristics and evaluate their compatibility with the stakeholders’ incentives. Our analysis leads to a number of key findings, observations, and research questions that we believe will be of interest to practitioners, policy makers, and researchers.},

abstract = {Edmund C. Berkeley (1909--1988) was a mathematician, insurance actuary, inventor, publisher, and a founder of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). His book “Giant Brains or Machines That Think” (1949) was the first explanation of computers for a general readership. His journal "Computers and Automation" (1951--1973) was the first journal for computer professionals. In the 1950s, Berkeley developed mail-order kits for small, personal computers such as Simple Simon and the Brainiac. In an era when computer development was on a scale barely affordable by universities or government agencies, Berkeley took a different approach and sold simple computer kits to average Americans. He believed that digital computers, using mechanized reasoning based on symbolic logic, could help people make more rational decisions. The result of this improved reasoning would be better social conditions and fewer large-scale wars. Although Berkeley's populist notions of computer development in the public interest did not prevail, the events of his life exemplify the human side of ongoing debates concerning the social responsibility of computer professionals. This biography of Edmund Berkeley, based on primary sources gathered over 15 years of archival research, provides a lens to understand social and political decisions surrounding early computer development, and the consequences of these decisions in our 21st century lives.}
