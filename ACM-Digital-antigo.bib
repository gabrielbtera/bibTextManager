abstract = {The insurance field is going through a phase of great transformation due to the growth of new technologies and techniques that are causing a change in the way data is handled and analyzed. The main perpetrator of this phenomenon is the introduction of Machine Learning (ML) in financial decision-making due to their efficiency and productivity. However, there is a new intervenient in the room, which will automate and support all steps of ML system development. Machine Learning Operations (MLOPs) will reduce technical friction, so that the model may move from an idea into production, in the shortest amount of time, and subsequently to market with the least possible risk. In this paper, a detailed review of the impacts of ML on insurance premium forecasting and the influence that MLOPs can have on forecasting outcomes is provided. Furthermore, a comprehensive summary is presented of crucial principles in the insurance industry, which are essential for comprehending the role that MLOPs will play in tailoring and individualizing insurance policies and premiums.},

abstract = {If we want a future where AI serves a plurality of interests, then we should pay attention to the factors that drive its success. While others have studied the importance of data, hardware, and models in directing the trajectory of AI, we argue that open source software is a neglected factor shaping AI as a discipline. We start with the observation that almost all AI research and applications are built on machine learning open source software (MLOSS). This paper presents three contributions. First, it quantifies the outsized impact of MLOSS by using Github contributions data. By contrasting the costs of MLOSS and its economic benefits, we find that the average dollar of MLOSS investment corresponds to at least $100 of global economic value created, corresponding to $30B of economic value created this year. Second, we leverage interviews with AI researchers and developers to develop a causal model of the effect of open sourcing on economic value. We argue that open sourcing creates value through three primary mechanisms: standardization of MLOSS tools, increased experimentation in AI research, and creation of communities. Finally, we consider the incentives for developing MLOSS and the broader implications of these effects. We intend this paper to be useful for technologists and academics who want to analyze and critique AI, and policymakers who want to better understand and regulate AI systems.},

We have characterized emerging research in this area through a systematic literature review examining oracle types, researcher goals, the ML techniques applied, how the generation process was assessed, and the open research challenges in this emerging field. Based on a sample of 22 relevant studies, we observed that ML algorithms generated test verdict, metamorphic relation, and---most commonly---expected output oracles. Almost all studies employ a supervised or semi-supervised approach, trained on labeled system executions or code metadata---including neural networks, support vector machines, adaptive boosting, and decision trees. Oracles are evaluated using the mutation score, correct classifications, accuracy, and ROC. Work-to-date show great promise, but there are significant open challenges regarding the requirements imposed on training data, the complexity of modeled functions, the ML algorithms employed---and how they are applied---the benchmarks used by researchers, and replicability of the studies. We hope that our findings will serve as a roadmap and inspiration for researchers in this field.},

Any biases introduced during training (implicit or explicit) are often reflected in the system's behaviors leading to questions about fairness and loss of trust in the system. Yet, information on training data is rarely communicated to stakeholders. In this work, we explore the concept of data-centric explanations for ML systems that describe the training data to end-users. Through a formative study, we investigate the potential utility of such an approach, including the information about training data that participants find most compelling. In a second study, we investigate reactions to our explanations across four different system scenarios. Our results suggest that data-centric explanations have the potential to impact how users judge the trustworthiness of a system and to assist users in assessing fairness. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing explanations to support users’ perceptions of ML systems.},

abstract = {Quality-sensitive applications of machine learning (ML) require quality assurance (QA) by humans before the predictions of an ML model can be deployed. QA for ML (QA4ML) interfaces require users to view a large amount of data and perform many interactions to correct errors made by the ML model. An optimized user interface (UI) can significantly reduce interaction costs. While UI optimization can be informed by user studies evaluating design options, this approach is not scalable because there are typically numerous small variations that can affect the efficiency of a QA4ML interface. Hence, we propose using simulation to evaluate and aid the optimization of QA4ML interfaces. In particular, we focus on simulating the combined effects of human intelligence in initiating appropriate interaction commands and machine intelligence in providing algorithmic assistance for accelerating QA4ML processes. As QA4ML is usually labor-intensive, we use the simulated task completion time as the metric for UI optimization under different interface and algorithm setups. We demonstrate the usage of this UI design method in several QA4ML applications.},

The concept of opinion or sentiment analysis is often used to predict or classify the textual data, sentiment, affect, subjectivity, and other emotional states in online text. Recognizing the message's positive and negative thoughts or opinions by examining the author's goals will aid in a better understanding of the text's content in terms of the stock market. An intelligent ontology and knowledge Asian social network solution can improve the effectiveness of a company's decision making support procedures by deriving important information about users from a wide variety of web sources. However, ontology is concerned primarily with problem-solving knowledge discovery. The utilization of Internet-based modernizations welcomed a significant effect on the Indian stock exchange. News related to the stock market in the most recent decade plays a vital role for the brokers or users. This article focuses on predicting stock market news sentiments based on their polarity and textual information using the concept of ontological knowledge-based Convolution Neural Network (CNN) as a machine learning approach. Optimal features are essential for the sentiment classification model to predict the stock's textual reviews' exact sentiment. Therefore, the swarm-based Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is utilized with the Lexicon feature extraction approach using a novel fitness function. The main motivation for combining ABC and CNN is to accelerate model training, which is why the suggested approach is effective in predicting emotions from stock news.},

Within the software development process, the testing stage of an ML system is more critical, considering that it is necessary to add data validation, trained model quality evaluation, and model validation to traditional unit, integration tests and system tests. In this paper, we focus on reporting the lessons learned of using model testing and exploratory testing within the context of the agile development process of an ML system that predicts lawsuits proneness in energy supply companies. Through the development of the project, the SCRUM agile methodology was applied and activities related to the development of the ML model and the development of the end-user application were defined. After the testing process of the ML model, we managed to achieve 93.89 accuracy; 95.58 specificity; 88.84 sensitivity; and 87.09 precision. Furthermore, we focused on the quality of use of the application embedding the ML model, by carrying out exploratory testing. As a result, through several iterations, different types of defects were identified and corrected. Our lessons learned support software engineers willing to develop ML systems that consider both the ML model and the end-user application.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the deployment of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques based on transformer technology, across many domains and applications. However, in legal domains, due to the complexity, length, and sparsity of legal case documents, the use of these advanced NLP techniques has offered comparatively slight returns. Perhaps even more importantly, such methods are critically lacking in explainability and justification of outputs, which are essential for many legal applications. We propose that the direction of these NLP techniques should be aimed at ascription to a legal knowledge model, which can then provide the necessary and auditable justifications for the rationale of any case outcome. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of using Hierarchical Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (H-BERT) models to ascribe to an Angelic Domain Model (ADM) that is able to represent the legal knowledge of a domain in a structured way, enabling justifications and improving performance. Our study involved an annotation task on a popular domain, cases from the European Court of Human Rights, to gain an understanding of the balance of complaints in the domain. The data set produced from this study enabled training of models for factor ascription using the classification targets derived from the annotations. We present results of experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the ascription task at three different levels of abstraction within the structured model.},

abstract = {Creating and maintaining a platform for reliably producing and deploying machine learning models requires careful orchestration of many components---a learner for generating models based on training data, modules for analyzing and validating both data as well as models, and finally infrastructure for serving models in production. This becomes particularly challenging when data changes over time and fresh models need to be produced continuously. Unfortunately, such orchestration is often done ad hoc using glue code and custom scripts developed by individual teams for specific use cases, leading to duplicated effort and fragile systems with high technical debt.We present TensorFlow Extended (TFX), a TensorFlow-based general-purpose machine learning platform implemented at Google. By integrating the aforementioned components into one platform, we were able to standardize the components, simplify the platform configuration, and reduce the time to production from the order of months to weeks, while providing platform stability that minimizes disruptions.We present the case study of one deployment of TFX in the Google Play app store, where the machine learning models are refreshed continuously as new data arrive. Deploying TFX led to reduced custom code, faster experiment cycles, and a 2% increase in app installs resulting from improved data and model analysis.},

abstract = {When building a classifier in interactive machine learning (iML), human knowledge about the target class can be a powerful reference to make the classifier robust to unseen items. The main challenge lies in finding unlabeled items that can either help discover or refine concepts for which the current classifier has no corresponding features (i.e., it has feature blindness). Yet it is unrealistic to ask humans to come up with an exhaustive list of items, especially for rare concepts that are hard to recall. This article presents AnchorViz, an interactive visualization that facilitates the discovery of prediction errors and previously unseen concepts through human-driven semantic data exploration. By creating example-based or dictionary-based anchors representing concepts, users create a topology that (a) spreads data based on their similarity to the concepts and (b) surfaces the prediction and label inconsistencies between data points that are semantically related. Once such inconsistencies and errors are discovered, users can encode the new information as labels or features and interact with the retrained classifier to validate their actions in an iterative loop. We evaluated AnchorViz through two user studies. Our results show that AnchorViz helps users discover more prediction errors than stratified random and uncertainty sampling methods. Furthermore, during the beginning stages of a training task, an iML tool with AnchorViz can help users build classifiers comparable to the ones built with the same tool with uncertainty sampling and keyword search, but with fewer labels and more generalizable features. We discuss exploration strategies observed during the two studies and how AnchorViz supports discovering, labeling, and refining of concepts through a sensemaking loop.},

Manual customer satisfaction surveys, however, provide limited values due to high cost and the time lapse between the service and the survey.In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to automatically measure customer satisfaction by analyzing call transcripts enabling companies to measure customer satisfaction for every call in near real-time. We have identified various features from multiple knowledge sources indicating prosodic, linguistic and behavioral aspects of the speakers, and built machine learning models that predict the degree of customer satisfaction with high accuracy. The machine learning algorithms used in this work include Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).Experiments were conducted for a 5-point satisfaction measurement and a 2-point satisfaction measurement using customer calls to an automotive company. The experimental results show that customer satisfaction can be measured quite accurately both at the end of calls and in the middle of calls. The best performing 5-point satisfaction classification yields an accuracy of 66.09% outperforming the DominantClass baseline by 15.16%. The best performing 2-point classification shows an accuracy of 89.42% and outperforms both the DominantClass baseline and the CSRJudgment baseline by 17.7% and 3.3% respectively. Furthermore, Decision Tree and SVMs achieve higher F-measure than the CSRJudgment baseline in identifying both satisfied customers and dissatisfied customers.},

abstract = {We present a no-code Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform called Trinity with the main design goal of enabling both machine learning researchers and non-technical geospatial domain experts to experiment with domain-specific signals and datasets for solving a variety of complex problems on their own. This versatility to solve diverse problems is achieved by transforming complex Spatio-temporal datasets to make them consumable by standard deep learning models, in this case, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and giving the ability to formulate disparate problems in a standard way, eg. semantic segmentation. With an intuitive user interface, a feature store that hosts derivatives of complex feature engineering, a deep learning kernel, and a scalable data processing mechanism, Trinity provides a powerful platform for domain experts to share the stage with scientists and engineers in solving business-critical problems. It enables quick prototyping, rapid experimentation and reduces the time to production by standardizing model building and deployment. In this paper, we present our motivation behind Trinity and its design along with showcasing sample applications to motivate the idea of lowering the bar to using AI.},

abstract = {Recent advances in AI and machine learning (ML) promise significant transformations in the future delivery of healthcare. Despite a surge in research and development, few works have moved beyond demonstrations of technical feasibility and algorithmic performance. However, to realize many of the ambitious visions for how AI can contribute to clinical impact requires the closer design and study of AI tools or interventions within specific health and care contexts. This article outlines our collaborative, human-centered approach to developing an AI application that predicts treatment outcomes for patients who are receiving human-supported, internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) for symptoms of depression and anxiety. Intersecting the fields of HCI, AI, and healthcare, we describe how we addressed the specific challenges of (1) identifying clinically relevant AI applications; and (2) designing AI applications for sensitive use contexts like mental health. Aiming to better assist the work practices of iCBT supporters, we share how learnings from an interview study with 15 iCBT supporters surfaced their practices and information needs and revealed new opportunities for the use of AI. Combined with insights from the clinical literature and technical feasibility constraints, this led to the development of two clinical outcome prediction models. To clarify their potential utility for use in practice, we conducted 13 design sessions with iCBT supporters that utilized interface mock-ups to concretize the AI output and derive additional design requirements. Our findings demonstrate how design choices can impact interpretations of the AI predictions as well as supporter motivation and sense of agency. We detail how this analysis and the design principles derived from it enabled the integration of the prediction models into a production interface. Reporting on identified risks of over-reliance on AI outputs and needs for balanced information assessment and preservation of a focus on individualized care, we discuss and reflect on what constitutes a responsible, human-centered approach to AI design in this healthcare context.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis in software engineering (SE) has shown promise to analyze and support diverse development activities. Recently, several tools are proposed to detect sentiments in software artifacts. While the tools improve accuracy over off-the-shelf tools, recent research shows that their performance could still be unsatisfactory. A more accurate sentiment detector for SE can help reduce noise in analysis of software scenarios where sentiment analysis is required. Recently, combinations, i.e., hybrids of stand-alone classifiers are found to offer better performance than the stand-alone classifiers for fault detection. However, we are aware of no such approach for sentiment detection for software artifacts. We report the results of an empirical study that we conducted to determine the feasibility of developing an ensemble engine by combining the polarity labels of stand-alone SE-specific sentiment detectors. Our study has two phases. In the first phase, we pick five SE-specific sentiment detection tools from two recently published papers by Lin et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;[29, 30], who first reported negative results with stand alone sentiment detectors and then proposed an improved SE-specific sentiment detector, POME&nbsp;[29]. We report the study results on 17,581 units (sentences/documents) coming from six currently available sentiment benchmarks for software engineering. We find that the existing tools can be complementary to each other in 85-95% of the cases, i.e., one is wrong but another is right. However, a majority voting-based ensemble of those tools fails to improve the accuracy of sentiment detection. We develop Sentisead, a supervised tool by combining the polarity labels and bag of words as features. Sentisead improves the performance (F1-score) of the individual tools by 4% (over Senti4SD&nbsp;[5]) – 100% (over POME&nbsp;[29]). The initial development of Sentisead occurred before we observed the use of deep learning models for SE-specific sentiment detection. In particular, recent papers show the superiority of advanced language-based pre-trained transformer models (PTM) over rule-based and shallow learning models. Consequently, in a second phase, we compare and improve Sentisead infrastructure using the PTMs. We find that a Sentisead infrastructure with RoBERTa as the ensemble of the five stand-alone rule-based and shallow learning SE-specific tools from Lin et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;[29, 30] offers the best F1-score of 0.805 across the six datasets, while a stand-alone RoBERTa shows an F1-score of 0.801.},

abstract = {Turnover is the organizational movement of hiring and dismissing employees motivated by different reasons, such as termination, retirement, and resignations. High turnover rates can be harmful to organizational productivity, potentially disrupting investments in human resources, generating loss of tacit knowledge and non-scheduled costs with staff replacement. Usually, organizations are unprepared for premature employee resignation, and the problems arising from turnover are even more harmful in this case. Estimating the employees inclination to resignation is paramount to reduce turnover, thereby reducing its negative impact on organizational performance. In this article, we exploit LinkedIn to predict employee resignation likelihood. Particularly, we introduce the ERP approach, which collect professional profiles from LinkedIn and use them as a source of features about employees inclination to resignation. Additionally, we evaluate different algorithms used by ERP to classify employees, considering their resignation likelihood. Experimental results show that the decision tree is the most effective algorithm, classifying correctly more than 88% of the employees. Furthermore the kappa measure show a substantial agreement between the decision tree and an optimal classifier.},

abstract = {The wide adoption of Machine Learning (ML) technologies has created a growing demand for people who can train ML models. Some advocated the term "machine teacher'' to refer to the role of people who inject domain knowledge into ML models. This "teaching'' perspective emphasizes supporting the productivity and mental wellbeing of machine teachers through efficient learning algorithms and thoughtful design of human-AI interfaces. One promising learning paradigm is Active Learning (AL), by which the model intelligently selects instances to query a machine teacher for labels, so that the labeling workload could be largely reduced. However, in current AL settings, the human-AI interface remains minimal and opaque. A dearth of empirical studies further hinders us from developing teacher-friendly interfaces for AL algorithms. In this work, we begin considering AI explanations as a core element of the human-AI interface for teaching machines. When a human student learns, it is a common pattern to present one's own reasoning and solicit feedback from the teacher. When a ML model learns and still makes mistakes, the teacher ought to be able to understand the reasoning underlying its mistakes. When the model matures, the teacher should be able to recognize its progress in order to trust and feel confident about their teaching outcome. Toward this vision, we propose a novel paradigm of explainable active learning (XAL), by introducing techniques from the surging field of explainable AI (XAI) into an AL setting. We conducted an empirical study comparing the model learning outcomes, feedback content and experience with XAL, to that of traditional AL and coactive learning (providing the model's prediction without explanation). Our study shows benefits of AI explanation as interfaces for machine teaching--supporting trust calibration and enabling rich forms of teaching feedback, and potential drawbacks--anchoring effect with the model judgment and additional cognitive workload. Our study also reveals important individual factors that mediate a machine teacher's reception to AI explanations, including task knowledge, AI experience and Need for Cognition. By reflecting on the results, we suggest future directions and design implications for XAL, and more broadly, machine teaching through AI explanations.},

While scholarly interest in model interpretability has grown rapidly in research communities like HCI, ML, and beyond, little is known about how practitioners perceive and aim to provide interpretability in the context of their existing workflows. This lack of understanding of interpretability as practiced may prevent interpretability research from addressing important needs, or lead to unrealistic solutions. To bridge this gap, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners to understand how they conceive of and design for interpretability while they plan, build, and use their models. Based on a qualitative analysis of our results, we differentiate interpretability roles, processes, goals and strategies as they exist within organizations making heavy use of ML models. The characterization of interpretability work that emerges from our analysis suggests that model interpretability frequently involves cooperation and mental model comparison between people in different roles, often aimed at building trust not only between people and models but also between people within the organization. We present implications for design that discuss gaps between the interpretability challenges that practitioners face in their practice and approaches proposed in the literature, highlighting possible research directions that can better address real-world needs.},

abstract = {Food safety is an important health issue in Singapore as the number of food poisoning cases have increased significantly over the past few decades. The National Environment Agency of Singapore (NEA) is the primary government agency responsible for monitoring and mitigating the food safety risks. In an effort to pro-actively monitor emerging food safety issues and to stay abreast with developments related to food safety in the world, NEA tracks the World Wide Web as a source of news feeds to identify food safety related articles. However, such information gathering is a difficult and time consuming process due to information overload. In this paper, we present FoodSIS, a system for end-to-end web information gathering for food safety. FoodSIS improves efficiency of such focused information gathering process with the use of machine learning techniques to identify and rank relevant content. We discuss the challenges in building such a system and describe how thoughtful system design and recent advances in machine learning provide a framework that synthesizes interactive learning with classification to provide a system that is used in daily operations. We conduct experiments and demonstrate that our classification approach results in improving the efficiency by average 35% compared to a conventional approach and the ranking approach leads to average 16% improvement in elevating the ranks of relevant articles.},

publisher = {BCS Learning &amp; Development Ltd.},
address = {Swindon, GBR},
abstract = {Modern lighting systems allow for light settings that are more in tune with users' activities, by going beyond mere functional illumination. These systems have a large amount of controllable parameters such as intensity and colour of individual light sources. Using an autonomous control system is therefore an attractive option, especially since such control systems may also lead to reduced energy consumption. From a user experience point of view however, there are certain drawbacks to this automation.This paper proposes a hybrid approach towards lighting control to create a dynamic balance between user control and system automation. Such a hybrid system has the ability to autonomously set the lighting according to its knowledge about the current context, while offering users the possibility to manually adapt the light settings. These manual adaptations can in turn be used by the system to learn about user preferences in various situations, and thereby to improve its future lighting suggestions.To explore and evaluate this approach, a smart lighting system was developed as an initial implementation, and installed in a real office environment. The system employs a machine learning algorithm to achieve intelligent behaviour and provides users with an interface to control the lights and give feedback to the system. In a six-week study, the user experience of this initial implementation is evaluated. The results provide an insight in design considerations when adopting this approach for the design of smart lighting control systems. The considerations regard the type of machine learning, the degrees of freedom offered to the user, the insight in the system's decision making process, and the user interface.},

This guide may broaden its users’ awareness of potential ethical issues, important features of ethical issues and their mitigations, and the breadth of available mitigations.

We define data annotation as a sense-making practice, where annotators assign meaning to data through the use of labels. Previous human-centered investigations have largely focused on annotators? subjectivity as a major cause of biased labels. We propose a wider view on this issue: guided by constructivist grounded theory, we conducted several weeks of fieldwork at two annotation companies. We analyzed which structures, power relations, and naturalized impositions shape the interpretation of data. Our results show that the work of annotators is profoundly informed by the interests, values, and priorities of other actors above their station. Arbitrary classifications are vertically imposed on annotators, and through them, on data. This imposition is largely naturalized. Assigning meaning to data is often presented as a technical matter. This paper shows it is, in fact, an exercise of power with multiple implications for individuals and society.},

abstract = {Measurement-based approaches to software performance engineering apply analysis methods (e.g., statistical inference or machine learning) on raw measurement data with the goal to build a mathematical model describing the performance-relevant behavior of a system under test (SUT). The main challenge for such approaches is to find a reasonable trade-off between minimizing the amount of necessary measurement data used to build the model and maximizing the model's accuracy. Most existing methods require prior knowledge about parameter dependencies or their models are limited to only linear correlations. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of genetic programming (GP) to derive a mathematical equation expressing the performance behavior of the measured system (software performance curve). We systematically optimized the parameters of the GP algorithm to derive accurate software performance curves and applied techniques to prevent overfitting. We conducted an evaluation with a representative MySQL database system. The results clearly show that the GP algorithm outperforms other analysis techniques like inverse distance weighting (IDW) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) in terms of model accuracy.},

abstract = {The task and worker recommendation problems in crowdsourcing systems have brought up unique characteristics that are not present in traditional recommendation scenarios, i.e., the huge flow of tasks with short lifespans, the importance of workers’ capabilities, and the quality of the completed tasks. These unique features make traditional recommendation approaches no longer satisfactory for task and worker recommendation in crowdsourcing systems. In this article, we propose a two-tier data representation scheme (defining a worker--category suitability score and a worker--task attractiveness score) to support personalized task and worker recommendations. We also extend two optimization methods, namely least mean square error and Bayesian personalized rank, to better fit the characteristics of task/worker recommendation in crowdsourcing systems. We then integrate the proposed representation scheme and the extended optimization methods along with the two adapted popular learning models, i.e., matrix factorization and kNN, and result in two lines of top-N recommendation algorithms for crowdsourcing systems: (1) Top-N-Tasks recommendation algorithms for discovering the top-N most suitable tasks for a given worker and (2) Top-N-Workers recommendation algorithms for identifying the top-N best workers for a task requester. An extensive experimental study is conducted that validates the effectiveness and efficiency of a broad spectrum of algorithms, accompanied by our analysis and the insights gained.},

abstract = {Ensemble Effort Estimation (EEE) consists on predicting the software development effort by combining more than one single estimation technique. EEE has recently been investigated in software development effort estimation (SDEE) in order to improve the estimation accuracy. The overall results suggested that the EEE yield better prediction accuracy than single techniques. On the other hand, feature selection (FS) methods have been used in the area of SDEE for the purpose of reducing the dimensionality of a dataset size by eliminating the irrelevant and redundant features. Thus, the SDEE techniques are trained on a dataset with relevant features which can lead to improving the accuracy of their estimations. This paper aims at investigating the impact of two Filter feature selection methods: Correlation based Feature Selection (CFS) and RReliefF on the estimation accuracy of Heterogeneous (HT) ensembles. Four machine learning techniques (K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Regression, Multilayer Perceptron and Decision Trees) were used as base techniques for the HT ensembles of this study. We evaluate the accuracy of these HT ensembles when their base techniques were trained on datasets preprocessed by the two feature selection methods. The HT ensembles use three combination rules: average, median, and inverse ranked weighted mean. The evaluation was carried out by means of eight unbiased accuracy measures through the leave-one-out-cross validation (LOOCV) technique over six datasets. The overall results suggest that all the attributes of most datasets used are relevant for building an accurate predictive technique since the ensembles constructed without features selection outperformed in general the ones using features selection. As for the combination rule, the median generally produces better results than the other two used in this empirical study.},

However, taking a step back and acknowledging that flow occurs during periods of focus gives us the opportunity to make progress towards measuring flow by isolating focused work. Here, we take a mixed-methods approach to design a logs-based metric that leverages machine learning and a comprehensive collection of logs data to identify periods of related actions (indicating focus), and validate this metric against self-reported time in focus or flow using diary data and quarterly survey data. Our results indicate that we can determine when software engineers at a large technology company experience focused work which includes instances of flow. This metric speaks to engineering work, but can be leveraged in other domains to non-disruptively measure when people experience focus. Future research can build upon this work to identify signals associated with other facets of flow.},

abstract = {Mobile phones provide a powerful sensing platform that researchers may adopt to understand proximity interactions among people and the diffusion, through these interactions, of diseases, behaviors, and opinions. However, it remains a challenge to track the proximity-based interactions of a whole community and then model the social diffusion of diseases and behaviors starting from the observations of a small fraction of the volunteer population. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that tries to connect together these sparse observations using a model of how individuals interact with each other and how social interactions happen in terms of a sequence of proximity interactions. We apply our approach to track the spreading of flu in the spatial-proximity network of a 3000-people university campus by mobilizing 300 volunteers from this population to monitor nearby mobile phones through Bluetooth scanning and to daily report flu symptoms about and around them. Our aim is to predict the likelihood for an individual to get flu based on how often her/his daily routine intersects with those of the volunteers. Thus, we use the daily routines of the volunteers to build a model of the volunteers as well as of the non-volunteers. Our results show that we can predict flu infection two weeks ahead of time with an average precision from 0.24 to 0.35 depending on the amount of information. This precision is six to nine times higher than with a random guess model. At the population level, we can predict infectious population in a two-week window with an r-squared value of 0.95 (a random-guess model obtains an r-squared value of 0.2). These results point to an innovative approach for tracking individuals who have interacted with people showing symptoms, allowing us to warn those in danger of infection and to inform health researchers about the progression of contact-induced diseases.},

Current methodologies are limited in capturing subjective differences in expectations, needs, and values at work, and they do not lay emphasis on demographic differences, which may impact people's perceptions of job satisfaction. This study proposes an approach to assess job satisfaction by leveraging large-scale social media data. Starting with an initial Twitter dataset of 1.5M posts, we examine two facets of job satisfaction, pay and supervision. By adopting a theory-driven approach, we first build machine learning classifiers to assess perceived job satisfaction with an average AUC of 0.84. We then study demographic differences in perceived job satisfaction by geography, sex, and race in the U.S. For geography, we find that job satisfaction on Twitter exhibits insightful relationships with macroeconomic indicators such as financial wellbeing and unemployment rates. For sex and race, we find that females express greater pay satisfaction but lower supervision satisfaction than males, whereas Whites express the least pay and supervision satisfaction. Unpacking linguistic differences, we find contrasts in different groups' underlying priorities and concerns, e.g., under-represented groups saliently express about basic livelihood, whereas the majority groups saliently express about self-actualization. We discuss the role of frame of reference and the "job satisfaction paradox", conceptualized by organizational psychologists, in explaining our observed differences. We conclude with theoretical and sociotechnical implications of our work for understanding and improving worker wellbeing.},

However, success has been accompanied with a major new arising challenge: Many applications of machine learning (ML) are adversarial in nature [146]. In recent years, it has been shown that these methods are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., subtle but non-random perturbations designed to force recommendation models to produce erroneous outputs.The goal of this survey is two-fold: (i) to present recent advances on adversarial machine learning (AML) for the security of RS (i.e., attacking and defense recommendation models) and (ii) to show another successful application of AML in generative adversarial networks (GANs) for generative applications, thanks to their ability for learning (high-dimensional) data distributions. In this survey, we provide an exhaustive literature review of 76 articles published in major RS and ML journals and conferences. This review serves as a reference for the RS community working on the security of RS or on generative models using GANs to improve their quality.},

We describe a series of user-centred studies to probe the creative benefits of these agents and adapting their design to exploration. Preliminary studies observing users’ exploration strategies with parametric interfaces and testing different agent exploration behaviours led to the design of a fully-functioning prototype, called Co-Explorer, that we evaluated in a workshop with professional sound designers. We found that the Co-Explorer enables a novel creative workflow centred on human–machine partnership, which has been positively received by practitioners. We also highlight varied user exploration behaviours throughout partnering with our system. Finally, we frame design guidelines for enabling such co-exploration workflow in creative digital applications.},

Moreover, several approaches have investigated the relationship between TD and vulnerabilities, however, the generalizability and validity of findings are limited due to small dataset. In this study, we aim to identify TD through multiple phases of development, and to automatically measure it through data and text mining techniques to form a comprehensive feature model. We plan to utilize neural network based classifiers that will incorporate evolutionary changes on TD measures into predicting vulnerabilities.

Following this quantifiable decision making, users are allowed to refine several decision factors in order to make decisions of high quality and with low difficulty levels. A case study of driving route selection is used to set up an experiment to test our hypotheses. In this study, GSR features exhibit the best performance in indexing decision quality.

Our work shows that (a) it is possible to develop an efficient and reusable architecture for predicting programmer status, (b) the previous technique can be improved through aggregation of predicted status, (c) the improved technique correlates more with programmers' perception of whether they are stuck than that of observers manually watching the programmers, (d) the observers are quicker than the developers to conclude that programmers are stuck, (e) with appropriate training, the tool can be used to predict even the observers' perceptions, and (f) a group training model offers more accuracy than an individual one when the training and test exercises are the same and carried over a small time frame.},

abstract = {Neural networks (NNs) are currently a very popular topic in machine learning for both research and practice. GPUs are the dominant computing platform for research efforts and are also gaining popularity as a deployment platform for applications such as autonomous vehicles. As a result, GPU vendors such as NVIDIA have spent enormous effort to write special-purpose NN libraries. On other hardware targets, especially mobile GPUs, such vendor libraries are not generally available. Thus, the development of portable, open, high-performance, energy-efficient GPU code for NN operations would enable broader deployment of NN-based algorithms. A root problem is that high efficiency GPU programming suffers from high complexity, low productivity, and low portability. To address this, this work presents a framework to enable productive, high-efficiency GPU programming for NN computations across hardware platforms and programming models. In particular, the framework provides specific support for metaprogramming and autotuning of operations over ND-Arrays. To show the correctness and value of our framework and approach, we implement a selection of NN operations, covering the core operations needed for deploying three common image-processing neural networks. We target three different hardware platforms: NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm GPUs. On NVIDIA GPUs, we show both portability between OpenCL and CUDA as well competitive performance compared to the vendor library. On Qualcomm GPUs, we show that our framework enables productive development of target-specific optimizations, and achieves reasonable absolute performance. Finally, On AMD GPUs, we show initial results that indicate our framework can yield reasonable performance on a new platform with minimal effort.},

abstract = {Computer programs for graphing and analyzing time series data are widely available. For large data analysis applications, however, the analyst may invest a great deal of time navigating an ocean of data in order to find the relevant and interesting pieces. By making this process of discovery easier we can improve the productivity of the analyst. In this paper we describe a data analysis system composed of an eclectic combination of pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, and digital signal processing with the goal of providing some of the right tools. The machine is used to accept abstract descriptions of interesting or anomalous data and then to bring that data quickly into the user interface. The same tools can screen large datasets in the analyst's absence. The human analyst spends less time wading through graphs and numbers and more time answering the question of the day. Our goal is to empower the analyst by providing a higher-level language with which to manipulate, visualize, and restructure the semantic concepts of the domain.},

The accuracy of the first-stage parser on the standard Parseval metric matches that of the (Collins, 2003) parser on which it is based, despite the data fragmentation caused by the greatly enriched space of possible node labels. This first stage simultaneously achieves near state-of-the-art performance on recovering function tags with minimal modifications to the underlying parser, modifying less than ten lines of code. The second stage achieves state-of-the-art performance on the recovery of empty categories by combining a linguistically-informed architecture and a rich feature set with the power of modern machine learning methods.},

abstract = {Crowd employment is a new form of short-term and flexible employment that has emerged during the past decade. To understand this new form of employment, it is crucial to illuminate the underlying motivations of the workforce involved in it. This article introduces the Multidimensional Crowdworker Motivation Scale (MCMS), a scale for measuring the motivation of crowdworkers on microtask platforms. The MCMS is theoretically grounded in self-determination theory and tailored specifically to the context of paid crowdsourced microlabor. The scale measures the motivation of crowdworkers along six motivational dimensions, ranging from amotivation to intrinsic motivation. We validated the MCMS on data collected in ten countries and three income groups. Factor analyses demonstrated that the MCMS’s six dimensions showed good model fit, validity, and reliability. Furthermore, our measurement invariance tests showed that motivations measured with the MCMS are comparable across countries and income groups, and we present a first cross-country comparison of crowdworker motivations. This work constitutes an important first step toward understanding the motivations of the international crowd workforce.},

abstract = {Software developers need access to different kinds of information which is often dispersed among different documentation sources, such as API documentation or Stack Overflow. We present an approach to automatically augment API documentation with "insight sentences" from Stack Overflow---sentences that are related to a particular API type and that provide insight not contained in the API documentation of that type. Based on a development set of 1,574 sentences, we compare the performance of two state-of-the-art summarization techniques as well as a pattern-based approach for insight sentence extraction. We then present SISE, a novel machine learning based approach that uses as features the sentences themselves, their formatting, their question, their answer, and their authors as well as part-of-speech tags and the similarity of a sentence to the corresponding API documentation. With SISE, we were able to achieve a precision of 0.64 and a coverage of 0.7 on the development set. In a comparative study with eight software developers, we found that SISE resulted in the highest number of sentences that were considered to add useful information not found in the API documentation. These results indicate that taking into account the meta data available on Stack Overflow as well as part-of-speech tags can significantly improve unsupervised extraction approaches when applied to Stack Overflow data.},

In our work, we present a productivity agent which helps users schedule and block out time on their calendar to focus on important tasks, monitor and intervene with distractions, and reflect on their daily mood and goals in a single, standalone application. We created two different prototype versions of our agent: a text-based (TB) agent with a similar UI to a standard chatbot, and a more emotionally expressive virtual agent (VA) that employs a video avatar and the ability to detect and respond appropriately to users' emotions. We evaluated these two agent prototypes against an existing product (control) condition through a three-week, within subjects study design with 40 participants, across different work roles in a large organization. We found that participants scheduled 134% more time with the TB prototype, and 110% more time with the VA prototype for focused tasks compared to the control condition. Users reported that they felt more satisfied and productive with the VA agent. However, The perception of anthropomorphism in the VA was polarized, with several participants suggesting that the human appearance was unnecessary. We discuss important insights from our work for the future design of conversational agents for productivity, wellbeing, and focus in the workplace.},

abstract = {A great part of software development involves conceptualizing or communicating the underlying procedures and logic that needs to be expressed in programs. One major difficulty of programming is turning concept into code, especially when dealing with the APIs of unfamiliar libraries. Recently, there has been a proliferation of machine learning methods for code generation and retrieval from natural language queries, but these have primarily been evaluated purely based on retrieval accuracy or overlap of generated code with developer-written code, and the actual effect of these methods on the developer workflow is surprisingly unattested. In this article, we perform the first comprehensive investigation of the promise and challenges of using such technology inside the PyCharm IDE, asking, “At the current state of technology does it improve developer productivity or accuracy, how does it affect the developer experience, and what are the remaining gaps and challenges?” To facilitate the study, we first develop a plugin for the PyCharm IDE that implements a hybrid of code generation and code retrieval functionality, and we orchestrate virtual environments to enable collection of many user events (e.g., web browsing, keystrokes, fine-grained code edits). We ask developers with various backgrounds to complete 7 varieties of 14 Python programming tasks ranging from basic file manipulation to machine learning or data visualization, with or without the help of the plugin. While qualitative surveys of developer experience are largely positive, quantitative results with regards to increased productivity, code quality, or program correctness are inconclusive. Further analysis identifies several pain points that could improve the effectiveness of future machine learning-based code generation/retrieval developer assistants and demonstrates when developers prefer code generation over code retrieval and vice versa. We release all data and software to pave the road for future empirical studies on this topic, as well as development of better code generation models.},

Setting up the process of collecting such judgments is a challenge of its own, and the maintenance of judgments quality is an extremely important part of the process. One of the possible ways of controlling the quality is monitoring inter-assessor agreement level. But does the agreement level really reflect the quality of assessor's judgments? Indeed, if a group of assessors comes to a consensus, to what extent should we trust their collective opinion? In this paper, we investigate, whether the agreement level can be used as a metric for estimating the quality of assessor's judgments, and provide recommendations for the design of judgments collection workflow. Namely, we estimate the correlation between assessors' accuracy and agreement in the scope of several workflow designs and investigate which specific workflow features influence the accuracy of judgments the most.},

Our target is to identify the nonverbal cues and computational methodologies resulting in effective performance. This survey differs from its counterparts by involving the widest spectrum of social phenomena and interaction settings (free-standing conversations, meetings, dyads, and crowds). We also present a comprehensive summary of the related datasets and outline future research directions which are regarding the implementation of artificial intelligence, dataset curation, and privacy-preserving interaction analysis. Some major observations are: the most often used nonverbal cue, computational method, interaction environment, and sensing approach are speaking activity, support vector machines, and meetings composed of 3-4 persons equipped with microphones and cameras, respectively; multimodal features are prominently performing better; deep learning architectures showed improved performance in overall, but there exist many phenomena whose detection has never been implemented through deep models. We also identified several limitations such as the lack of scalable benchmarks, annotation reliability tests, cross-dataset experiments, and explainability analysis.},

Such analyses represent a particular case for traditional data engineering workflows, as results may be hard to interpret and judge whether they are correct or not, and where experimentation is a central theme. Oftentimes, there are certain aspects of a result which are suspicious and which should be further investigated to increase the trustworthiness of the workflow’s outcome. To this end, we advocate a semi-automated approach to reducing a workflow’s input data while preserving a specified outcome of interest, facilitating irregularity localization by narrowing down the search space for spotting corrupted input data or wrong assumptions made about it. We outline our vision on building engineering support for outcome-preserving input reduction within data analysis workflows, and report on preliminary results obtained from applying an early research prototype on a computational notebook taken from an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners.},

abstract = {To reduce technical debt and make code more maintainable, it is important to be able to warn programmers about code smells. State-of-the-art code small detectors use deep learners, usually without exploring alternatives. For example, one promising alternative is GHOST (from TSE'21) that relies on a combination of hyper-parameter optimization of feedforward neural networks and a novel oversampling technique.The prior study from TSE'21 proposing this novel "fuzzy sampling" was somewhat limited in that the method was tested on defect prediction, but nothing else. Like defect prediction, code smell detection datasets have a class imbalance (which motivated "fuzzy sampling"). Hence, in this work we test if fuzzy sampling is useful for code smell detection.The results of this paper show that we can achieve better than state-of-the-art results on code smell detection with fuzzy oversampling. For example, for "feature envy", we were able to achieve 99+% AUC across all our datasets, and on 8/10 datasets for "misplaced class". While our specific results refer to code smell detection, they do suggest other lessons for other kinds of analytics. For example: (a) try better preprocessing before trying complex learners (b) include simpler learners as a baseline in software analytics (c) try "fuzzy sampling" as one such baseline.In order to support others trying to reproduce/extend/refute this work, all our code and data is available online at https://github.com/yrahul3910/code-smell-detection.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data, including web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents, and social media (such as blog articles, forum posts, product reviews, and tweets). This has led to an increasing demand for powerful software tools to help people manage and analyze vast amounts of text data effectively and efficiently. Unlike data generated by a computer system or sensors, text data are usually generated directly by humans, and capture semantically rich content. As such, text data are especially valuable for discovering knowledge about human opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. In contrast to structured data, which conform to well-defined schemas (thus are relatively easy for computers to handle), text has less explicit structure, requiring computer processing toward understanding of the content encoded in text. The current technology of natural language processing has not yet reached a point to enable a computer to precisely understand natural language text, but a wide range of statistical and heuristic approaches to management and analysis of text data have been developed over the past few decades. They are usually very robust and can be applied to analyze and manage text data in any natural language, and about any topic.This book provides a systematic introduction to many of these approaches, with an emphasis on covering the most useful knowledge and skills required to build a variety of practically useful text information systems. Because humans can understand natural languages far better than computers can, effective involvement of humans in a text information system is generally needed and text information systems often serve as intelligent assistants for humans. Depending on how a text information system collaborates with humans, we distinguish two kinds of text information systems. The first is information retrieval systems which include search engines and recommender systems; they assist users in finding from a large collection of text data the most relevant text data that are actually needed for solving a specific application problem, thus effecively turning big raw text data into much smaller relevant text data that can be more easily processed by humans. The second is text mining application systems; they can assist users in analyzing patterns in text data to extract and discover useful actionable knowledge directly useful for task completion or decision making, thus providing more direct task support for users. This book covers the major concepts, techniques, and ideas in information retrieval and text data mining from a practical viewpoint, and includes many hands-on exercises designed with a companion software toolkit (i.e., MeTA) to help readers learn how to apply techniques of information retrieval and text mining to real-world text data and how to experiment with and improve some of the algorithms for interesting application tasks. This book can be used as a textbook for computer science undergraduates and graduates, library and information scientists, or as a reference book for practitioners working on relevant problems in managing and analyzing text data.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied in software engineering to perform tasks such as translating code between programming languages, generating code from natural language, and autocompleting code as it is being written. When used within development tools, these systems typically treat each model invocation independently from all previous invocations, and only a specific limited functionality is exposed within the user interface. This approach to user interaction misses an opportunity for users to more deeply engage with the model by having the context of their previous interactions, as well as the context of their code, inform the model’s responses. We developed a prototype system – the Programmer’s Assistant – in order to explore the utility of conversational interactions grounded in code, as well as software engineers’ receptiveness to the idea of conversing with, rather than invoking, a code-fluent LLM. Through an evaluation with 42 participants with varied levels of programming experience, we found that our system was capable of conducting extended, multi-turn discussions, and that it enabled additional knowledge and capabilities beyond code generation to emerge from the LLM. Despite skeptical initial expectations for conversational programming assistance, participants were impressed by the breadth of the assistant’s capabilities, the quality of its responses, and its potential for improving their productivity. Our work demonstrates the unique potential of conversational interactions with LLMs for co-creative processes like software development.},

abstract = {Health and safety concerns have led to policies that put individuals under lockdown, but such restrictions lose effectiveness in the long-term due to inherent human needs of connection and physical action. People maintain prosocial behaviors long-term only if they make decisions themselves intrinsically as opposed to forced restrictions. To build systems for effecting positive social purpose in pandemic and environmental concerns, we apply speculative design to create story structures and interactions that promote behaviors for social good. We designed stories and interactions using both plot-based narrative frameworks and character-based machine-learning-generated dialogues for effecting cooperation. We then ran a series of workshops investigating how designers negotiate and collaborate to tell stories for social purpose using a "finish each other's stories" approach. This work illustrates the application of design fiction to promote sustainable behavioral patterns that value societal good.},

abstract = {E-contracts begin as legal documents and end up as processes that help organizations abide by legal rules while fulfilling contract terms. As contracts are complex, their deployment is predominantly established and fulfilled with significant human involvement. One of the key difficulties with any kind of contract processing is the legal ambiguity, which makes it difficult to address any violation of the contract terms. Thus, there is a need to track clauses for the contract activities under execution and violation of clauses. This necessitates deriving clause patterns from e-contract documents and map to their respective activities for further monitoring and fulfillment of e-contracts during their enactment. In this paper, we present a classification approach to extract clause patterns from e-contract documents. This is a challenging task as activities and clauses are mostly derived from both legal and business process driven contract knowledge.},

Since spam evolves continuously and most practical applications are based on online user feedback, the task calls for fast, incremental and robust learning algorithms. In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to spam filtering based on adaptive statistical data compression models. The nature of these models allows them to be employed as probabilistic text classifiers based on character-level or binary sequences. By modeling messages as sequences, tokenization and other error-prone preprocessing steps are omitted altogether, resulting in a method that is very robust. The models are also fast to construct and incrementally updateable. We evaluate the filtering performance of two different compression algorithms; dynamic Markov compression and prediction by partial matching. The results of our empirical evaluation indicate that compression models outperform currently established spam filters, as well as a number of methods proposed in previous studies.},

We argue that, in interpreting PPs, both knowledge about the site of the attachment (the traditional noun-verb attachment distinction) and the nature of the attachment (the distinction of arguments from adjuncts) are needed. We introduce a method to learn arguments and adjuncts based on a definition of arguments as a vector of features. In a series of supervised classification experiments, first we explore the features that enable us to learn the distinction between arguments and adjuncts. We find that both linguistic diagnostics of argumenthood and lexical semantic classes are useful. Second, we investigate the best method to reach the four-way classification of potentially ambiguous prepositional phrases. We find that whereas it is overall better to solve the problem as a single four-way classification task, verb arguments are sometimes more precisely identified if the classification is done as a two-step process, first choosing the attachment site and then labeling it as argument or adjunct.},

The easiest way to grow is to acquire more customers and retain them by offering them the highest possible level of satisfaction. Companies are then, forced to establish customer-centric strategies. In this paper, we are interested to the company performance through its customers (also called commercial performance). We propose a generic method for commercial performance evaluation; directed by the decision-makers needs and focused on three main axes relative to the customer perspective: customer's attraction, satisfaction and loyalty. These axes are defined by specific indicators, and are linked to increased revenue of the company and/or its market share. The evaluation of these indicators allows the estimation of the good (or bad) financial health of the company. We implemented the proposed method in a performance evaluation tool and applied it on the case study of a "Mobile Operator".},

The words in a multi-author paper are assumed to be the result of a mixture of each authors' topic mixture. The topic-word and author-topic distributions are learned from data in an unsupervised manner using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We apply the methodology to a large corpus of 160,000 abstracts and 85,000 authors from the well-known CiteSeer digital library, and learn a model with 300 topics. We discuss in detail the interpretation of the results discovered by the system including specific topic and author models, ranking of authors by topic and topics by author, significant trends in the computer science literature between 1990 and 2002, parsing of abstracts by topics and authors and detection of unusual papers by specific authors. An online query interface to the model is also discussed that allows interactive exploration of author-topic models for corpora such as CiteSeer.},

abstract = {Computer Vision (CV) has become an essential tool for developers looking to personalize user experiences. In particular, commercial CV services can be used by those who are not machine learning experts, but who want to enhance their apps and services with vision capabilities. While the performance of CV has become increasingly human-like, its “social behaviors" and their compatibility with human values are of concern. In contrast to algorithmic decision-making, where fairness is used to evaluate system behavior, CV is often evaluated for stereotyping – the extent to which systems reflect prevalent social beliefs. This paper proposes that viewing stereotyping negatively is unhelpful in improving human-AI interaction. Rather, it is more fruitful to separate the observation of a social behavior (i.e., documenting what a machine does in relation to a human) from its judgment (i.e., relating the behavior to social norms). As norms differ across contexts and application areas, such an approach better reflects the real world, which is characterized by diversity and opposing views. However, it requires us to face up to two truths: i) humans – not machines – are the problem; ii) we must decide what degree of human-likeness we ultimately want; technologies designed to mimic us will reflect social bias.},

abstract = {Based on humanistic psychology, this paper reflects on how and why technology has led to increasing dehumanization within society. The literature on human autonomy, or individuals’ ability to exercise agency and control over their own lives, emphasizes that erosion of autonomy adversely impacts human behavior and health—including demotivating people, heightening their anxiety and apathy, undermining interpersonal relations, reducing self-efficacy and learning, and damaging mental and physical health in substantial ways. This paper describes concrete examples of how technology is accelerating loss of human autonomy, which often occurs during invasive surveillance and covert manipulation during user-technology interactions. These examples highlight abuses of multimodal-multisensor technologies, especially during education. An analysis is provided of the psychosocial context that encourages people to use technology in abusive ways, which directly fuels the growing schism between those who control and those who are disempowered victims. Five specific directions are outlined for how our community can design future technology using counter tactics, practices, and policies that strengthen rather than eroding autonomy and well-being.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency is an important criterion to judge the quality of mobile apps, but one third of our randomly sampled apps suffer from energy issues that can quickly drain battery power. To understand these issues, we conducted an empirical study on 27 well-maintained apps such as Chrome and Firefox, whose issue tracking systems are publicly accessible. Our study revealed that the main root causes of energy issues include unnecessary workload and excessively frequent operations. Surprisingly, these issues are beyond the application of present technology on energy issue detection. We also found that 25.0% of energy issues can only manifest themselves under specific contexts such as poor network performance, but such contexts are again neglected by present technology. In this paper, we propose a novel testing framework for detecting energy issues in real-world mobile apps. Our framework examines apps with well-designed input sequences and runtime contexts. To identify the root causes mentioned above, we employed a machine learning algorithm to cluster the workloads and further evaluate their necessity. For the issues concealed by the specific contexts, we carefully set up several execution contexts to catch them. More importantly, we designed leading edge technology, e.g. pre-designing input sequences with potential energy overuse and tuning tests on-the-fly, to achieve high efficacy in detecting energy issues. A large-scale evaluation shows that 91.6% issues detected in our experiments were previously unknown to developers. On average, these issues double the energy costs of the apps. Our testing technique achieves a low number of false positives.},

abstract = {There is no scientific consensus on what is meant by “emotion” – researchers have examined various phenomena spanning brain modes, feelings, sensations, and cognitive structures, among others, in their study of emotional experiences. For the purposes of developing an AI speech emotion recognition (SER) system, however, emotion must be defined, bounded, and instantiated as ground truth in the training data. This means practical choices must be made in which particular emotional ontologies are prioritized over others in the construction of SER datasets. In this paper, I explore these tensions around fairness, accountability, and transparency by analyzing open-source datasets used for SER applications along with their accompanying methodology papers. Specifically, I critique the centrality of discrete emotion theory in SER applications as a contestable emotional framework that is invoked primarily for its practical utility and alignment – as opposed to scientific rigor – with machine learning epistemologies. In so doing, I also shed light on the role of the dataset creators as emotional designers in their attempt to produce, elicit, record, and index emotional expressions for the purposes of crafting SER training datasets. Ultimately, by further querying SER through the aperture of Critical Disability Studies, I use this empirical work to examine the sociopolitical stakes of SER as a normative and regulatory technology that siphons emotion into a broader agenda of capitalistic productivity in the context of call center optimization.},

We discovered that with online distractions blocked, participants assessed their focus and productivity to be significantly higher. Those who benefited most were those who reported being less in control of their work, associated with personality traits of lower Conscientiousness and Lack of Perseverence. Unexpectedly, those reporting higher control of work experienced a cost of higher workload with online distractions blocked. Those who reported the greatest increase in focus with distractions blocked were those who were more susceptible to social media distractions.

abstract = {We were delighted to welcome each participant at ASONAM 2022 and thank you for having contributed virtually or in person in Istanbul. ASONAM 2022 was the fourteenth annual conference in the successful ASONAM conferences series and also the first hybrid version of the conference. Previous ASONAM conferences were held in Athens (2009), Odense (2010), Kaohsiung (2011), Istanbul (2012), Niagara Falls (2013), Beijing (2014), Paris (2015), San Francisco (2016), Sydney (2017), Barcelona (2018), Vancouver (2019), Virtual (2020), Virtual (2021). The pre-pandemic locations of the conferences have enabled the participants to enjoy local sights and to engage in person-to-person interactions, making new contacts and form new scientific collaborations. These possibilities were only available in a limited form during the virtual conferences. As the covid pandemic seems to be moving towards an endemic form it was decided to have the conference in the hybrid form, as a move towards normal endemic in-person conferences.For more than a century, social networks have been studied in a variety of disciplines including sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics. The Internet, the social Web, and other large-scale, sociotechnological infrastructures have triggered a growing interest and resulted in significant methodological advancements in social network analysis and mining. Method development in graph theory, statistics, data mining, machine learning, and AI have inspired new research problems and, in turn, opens up further possibilities for application. These spiraling trends have led to a rising prominence of social network analysis and mining methods and tools in academia, politics, security, and business.},

abstract = {In an increasingly diverse and complex digital world a key challenge for companies is to maximize the productivity and motivation of their office workers. Thus, the task to measure, analyze and optimize the experience that these employees have with their digital devices becomes more and more important to ensure the competitiveness as well as the attractiveness of a company. In this paper end-user experience (EUE) includes measurable aspects such as boot-times, performance of tools and stability and availability of systems and software. In particular, for the IT administration, continuously optimizing the end-user experience is a considerable challenge. Our vision is to efficiently measure and quantify end-user experience and to automate the optimization of the infrastructure in order to support IT administrators. This paper shows an idea and a first concept for realization. A first step in measuring and evaluating end-user experience is to identify anomalies on endpoints. An endpoint can be any IT device used by the end-user. This paper presents a first implementation and evaluation of anomaly detection in IT infrastructures. First, the data collected on the endpoints is examined using a principal component analysis. Then, the data is analyzed for outliers using a neural network. For the implementation in this paper, an autoencoder is used. The evaluation of the results shows that an automated assessment of endpoint telemetry data using machine learning is possible. In summary, it is possible to detect anomalies in IT infrastructures using autoencoders. The anomalies in turn have an impact on the current or future end-user experience. In this way, autoencoder can be used in the future to improve the end-user experience of employees.},

abstract = {Reflection on one’s personal data can be an effective tool for supporting wellbeing. However, current wellbeing reflection support tools tend to offer a one-size-fits-all approach, ignoring the diversity of people’s wellbeing goals and their agency in the self-reflection process. In this work, we identify an opportunity to help people work toward their wellbeing goals by empowering them to reflect on their data on their own terms. Through a formative study, we inform the design and implementation of Pearl, a workplace wellbeing reflection support tool that allows users to explore their personal data in relation to their wellbeing goal. Pearl is a calendar-based interactive machine teaching system that allows users to visualize data sources and tag regions of interest on their calendar. In return, the system provides insights about these tags that can be saved to a reflection journal. We used Pearl as a technology probe with 12 participants without data science expertise and found that all participants successfully gained insights into their workplace wellbeing. In our analysis, we discuss how Pearl’s capabilities facilitate insights, the role of machine assistance in the self-reflection process, and the data sources that participants found most insightful. We conclude with design dimensions for intelligent reflection support systems as inspiration for future work.},

abstract = {A crucial but often neglected aspect of algorithmic fairness is the question of how we justify enforcing a certain fairness metric from a moral perspective. When fairness metrics are proposed, they are typically argued for by highlighting their mathematical properties. Rarely are the moral assumptions beneath the metric explained. Our aim in this paper is to consider the moral aspects associated with the statistical fairness criterion of independence (statistical parity). To this end, we consider previous work, which discusses the two worldviews "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) and "We're All Equal" (WAE) and by doing so provides some guidance for clarifying the possible assumptions in the design of algorithms. We present an extension of this work, which centers on morality. The most natural moral extension is that independence needs to be fulfilled if and only if differences in predictive features (e.g. high school grades and standardized test scores are predictive of performance at university) between socio-demographic groups are caused by unjust social disparities or measurement errors. Through two counterexamples, we demonstrate that this extension is not universally true. This means that the question of whether independence should be used or not cannot be satisfactorily answered by only considering the justness of differences in the predictive features.},

Previous research has indicated that awareness displays showing the workload of a target can reduce the harm interruptions inflict, but can increase the cognitive load on interrupters. This paper describes an experiment testing whether team membership influences interrupters' motivation to use awareness displays and whether the informational-intensity of a display influences its utility and cost. Results indicate interrupters use awareness displays to time communication only when they and their partners are rewarded as a team and that this timing improves the target's performance on a continuous attention task. Eye-tracking data shows that monitoring an information-rich display imposes a substantial attentional cost on the interrupters, and that an abstract display provides similar benefit with less distraction.},

abstract = {Prior work on creativity support tools demonstrates how a computational semantic model of a solution space can enable interventions that substantially improve the number, quality and diversity of ideas. However, automated semantic modeling often falls short when people contribute short text snippets or sketches. Innovation platforms can employ humans to provide semantic judgments to construct a semantic model, but this relies on external workers completing a large number of tedious micro tasks. This requirement threatens both accuracy (external workers may lack expertise and context to make accurate semantic judgments) and scalability (external workers are costly). In this paper, we introduce IdeaHound, an ideation system that seamlessly integrates the task of defining semantic relationships among ideas into the primary task of idea generation. The system combines implicit human actions with machine learning to create a computational semantic model of the emerging solution space. The integrated nature of these judgments allows IDEAHOUND to leverage the expertise and efforts of participants who are already motivated to contribute to idea generation, overcoming the issues of scalability inherent to existing approaches. Our results show that participants were equally willing to use (and just as productive using) IDEAHOUND compared to a conventional platform that did not require organizing ideas. Our integrated crowdsourcing approach also creates a more accurate semantic model than an existing crowdsourced approach (performed by external crowds). We demonstrate how this model enables helpful creative interventions: providing diverse inspirational examples, providing similar ideas for a given idea and providing a visual overview of the solution space.},

abstract = {Peer review is an evaluation strategy increasingly used in educational environments. It has now a central role in the field of teaching, but there is an extensive experience in the field of research. This evaluation method implies an author reviewing, usually anonymously, the work of his or her colleagues who, in turn, can become reviewers of the author's work. This peer evaluation system enriches the evaluation itself, and it can even become one of the few ways to assess the works in absence of a hierarchical authority on the subject. In massive access learning platforms it has even become the main assessment method. All in all, it is necessary to assure the quality of the assessment process. In this research we consider the process of peer review as a classification process, in which we have several classifiers (reviewers) that, before an input (work to revise) should assign a particular class (work grading). In this analysis two performance measures are proposed to assess the degree of goodness of the reviewers, in order to help improve the quality of peer review processes providing a more objective assessment of the reviewers task.},

The structure of linguistic processing that depends on the clear distinction between words and phrases has to be re-thought to accommodate MWEs. The issue of MWE handling is crucial for NLP applications, where it raises a number of challenges. The emergence of solutions in the absence of guiding principles motivates this survey, whose aim is not only to provide a focused review of MWE processing, but also to clarify the nature of interactions between MWE processing and downstream applications. We propose a conceptual framework within which challenges and research contributions can be positioned. It offers a shared understanding of what is meant by "MWE processing," distinguishing the subtasks of MWE discovery and identification. It also elucidates the interactions between MWE processing and two use cases: Parsing and machine translation. Many of the approaches in the literature can be differentiated according to how MWE processing is timed with respect to underlying use cases. We discuss how such orchestration choices affect the scope of MWE-aware systems. For each of the two MWE processing subtasks and for each of the two use cases, we conclude on open issues and research perspectives.},

Those automatic tools have enormous potential to support mental health assessment, clinical decision making, and treatment planning. In this paper, we investigate nonverbal behavioral markers of depression severity assessed during semi-structured medical interviews of adolescent patients. The main goal of our research is two-fold: studying a unique population of adolescents at high risk of mental disorders and differentiating mild depression from moderate or severe depression. We aim to explore computationally inferred facial and vocal behavioral responses elicited by three segments of the semi-structured medical interviews: Distress Assessment Questions, Ubiquitous Questions, and Concept Questions. Our experimental methodology reflects best practise used for analyzing small sample size and unbalanced datasets of unique patients. Our results show a very interesting trend with strongly discriminative behavioral markers from both acoustic and visual modalities. These promising results are likely due to the unique classification task (mild depression vs. moderate and severe depression) and three types of probing questions.},

They not only commit source code but also exert significant efforts on other communicative, organizational, and supportive activities. However, almost all prior research focuses on specific activities and fails to analyze elite developers’ activities in a comprehensive way. To bridge this gap, we conduct an empirical study with fine-grained event data from 20 large open source projects hosted on GITHUB. We investigate elite developers’ contributing activities and their impacts on project outcomes. Our analyses reveal three key findings: (1) elite developers participate in a variety of activities, of which technical contributions (e.g., coding) only account for a small proportion; (2) as the project grows, elite developers tend to put more effort into supportive and communicative activities and less effort into coding; and (3) elite developers’ efforts in nontechnical activities are negatively correlated with the project’s outcomes in terms of productivity and quality in general, except for a positive correlation with the bug fix rate (a quality indicator). These results provide an integrated view of elite developers’ activities and can inform an individual’s decision making about effort allocation, which could lead to improved project outcomes. The results also provide implications for supporting these elite developers.},

We compare multiple signal processing approaches for quantifying changes in occupant physiological state. Our findings show that MA significantly (p&lt;0.05) affect occupants’ perception as well as physiological response, which encouragingly correlate with occupants’ perception.

To bridge this gap, we conducted an in-situ study on building an open dataset with mobile and wearable devices for affective computing research (N = 100, 4 weeks). Our study results showed that a mixture of financial and altruistic benefits was important in eliciting data contribution. Sensor-specific risks were largely associated with the revelation of personal traits and social behaviors. However, most of the participants were less concerned with open dataset collection and their perceived sensitivity of each sensor data did not change over time. We further discuss alternative approaches to promote data contributors' motivations and suggest design guidelines to alleviate potential privacy concerns in mobile open dataset collection.},

The fine-grained analysis of such material is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive. This is not only difficult to scale, but, as a result, might also limit the quality and completeness of coding due to fatigue, inherent human biases, (accidental or intentional), and inter-rater inconsistencies. In this paper, we explore how recent advances in machine learning may reduce manual effort and loss of information while retaining the value of human intelligence in the coding process. We present ACACIA (AI Chain for Augmented Collaborative Interaction Analysis), an AI video data analysis application which combines a range of advances in machine perception of video material for the analysis of collaborative interaction. We evaluate ACACIA's abilities, show how far we can already get, and which challenges remain. Our contribution lies in establishing a combined machine and human analysis pipeline that may be generalized to different collaborative settings and guide future research.},

abstract = {Learning from human interaction data is a promising approach for developing robot interaction logic, but behaviors learned only from offline data simply represent the most frequent interaction patterns in the training data, without any adaptation for individual differences. We developed a robot that incorporates both data-driven and interactive learning. Our robot first learns high-level dialog and spatial behavior patterns from offline examples of human--human interaction. Then, during live interactions, it chooses among appropriate actions according to its curiosity about the customer's expected behavior, continually updating its predictive model to learn and adapt to each individual. In a user study, we found that participants thought the curious robot was significantly more humanlike with respect to repetitiveness and diversity of behavior, more interesting, and better overall in comparison to a non-curious robot.},

abstract = {This research presents a new benchmark dataset for evaluating Short Text Semantic Similarity (STSS) measurement algorithms and the methodology used for its creation. The power of the dataset is evaluated by using it to compare two established algorithms, STASIS and Latent Semantic Analysis. This dataset focuses on measures for use in Conversational Agents; other potential applications include email processing and data mining of social networks. Such applications involve integrating the STSS algorithm in a complex system, but STSS algorithms must be evaluated in their own right and compared with others for their effectiveness before systems integration. Semantic similarity is an artifact of human perception; therefore its evaluation is inherently empirical and requires benchmark datasets derived from human similarity ratings. The new dataset of 64 sentence pairs, STSS-131, has been designed to meet these requirements drawing on a range of resources from traditional grammar to cognitive neuroscience. The human ratings are obtained from a set of trials using new and improved experimental methods, with validated measures and statistics. The results illustrate the increased challenge and the potential longevity of the STSS-131 dataset as the Gold Standard for future STSS algorithm evaluation.},

Past research has focused on factors associated with the user and automation technology to explain reliance. The purpose of the present study was determining how the predictability of the environment affects reliance. In this paper, we present the results from an experiment using a digital game where participants had access to a free environmental cue of varying predictive validity. Some participants also had access to automated advice at varying costs. We found that participants underutilized automated advice in more predictable environments and when advice was more costly; however, when costs were low and the environment was less predictable, participants tended to overutilize automated advice. These findings provide insights for a more complete model of automation use, and offer a framework for understanding automation biases by considering how automation use compares to a model of optimality.},

In some situations, a normative workflow model of such processes is developed, and it becomes important to know if such a model is actually being followed by analyzing the available activity logs. In other scenarios, no model is available and, with the purpose of evaluating cases or creating new production policies, one is interested in learning a workflow representation of such activities. In either case, machine learning tools that can mine workflow models are of great interest and still relatively unexplored. We present here a probabilistic workflow model and a corresponding learning algorithm that runs in polynomial time. We illustrate the algorithm on example data derived from a real world workflow.},

abstract = {Refactoring aims at improving the internal structure of a software system without changing its external behavior. Previous studies empirically assessed, on the one hand, the benefits of refactoring in terms of code quality and developers' productivity, and on the other hand, the underlying reasons that push programmers to apply refactoring. Results achieved in the latter investigations indicate that besides personal motivation such as the responsibility concerned with code authorship, refactoring is mainly performed as a consequence of changes in the requirements rather than driven by software quality. However, these findings have been derived by surveying developers, and therefore no software repository study has been carried out to corroborate the achieved findings. To bridge this gap, we provide a quantitative investigation on the relationship between different types of code changes (i.e., Fault Repairing Modification, Feature Introduction Modification, and General Maintenance Modification) and 28 different refactoring types coming from 3 open source projects. Results showed that developers tend to apply a higher number of refactoring operations aimed at improving maintainability and comprehensibility of the source code when fixing bugs. Instead, when new features are implemented, more complex refactoring operations are performed to improve code cohesion. Most of the times, the underlying reasons behind the application of such refactoring operations are represented by the presence of duplicate code or previously introduced self-admitted technical debts.},

We show that some simple methods are indeed good indicators for the answer to the problem while other proposed methods fail to perform better than would be attributable to chance. In addition, one of the simplest methods, text frequency, dominates all others. We also apply two generic statistical learning methods for combining the indications of the individual methods, and compare their performance to the simple methods. The most sophisticated complex learning method offers a small, but statistically significant, improvement over the original tests.},

A list of criteria is established for the evaluation. By using scenario testing and structured questionnaires, qualitative feedback was collected from 43 Masters students. The findings reinforce and add to the concerns highlighted in other studies, in particular, the importance for shared awareness, privacy, conventions for interaction and the provision of an effective multimedia environment.

abstract = {Commenting source code has long been a common practice in software development. Compared to source code, comments are more direct, descriptive and easy-to-understand. Comments and sourcecode provide relatively redundant and independent information regarding a program's semantic behavior. As software evolves, they can easily grow out-of-sync, indicating two problems: (1) bugs -the source code does not follow the assumptions and requirements specified by correct program comments; (2) bad comments - comments that are inconsistent with correct code, which can confuse and mislead programmers to introduce bugs in subsequent versions. Unfortunately, as most comments are written in natural language, no solution has been proposed to automatically analyze commentsand detect inconsistencies between comments and source code. This paper takes the first step in automatically analyzing commentswritten in natural language to extract implicit program rulesand use these rules to automatically detect inconsistencies between comments and source code, indicating either bugs or bad comments. Our solution, iComment, combines Natural Language Processing(NLP), Machine Learning, Statistics and Program Analysis techniques to achieve these goals. We evaluate iComment on four large code bases: Linux, Mozilla, Wine and Apache. Our experimental results show that iComment automatically extracts 1832 rules from comments with 90.8-100% accuracy and detects 60 comment-code inconsistencies, 33 newbugs and 27 bad comments, in the latest versions of the four programs. Nineteen of them (12 bugs and 7 bad comments) have already been confirmed by the corresponding developers while the others are currently being analyzed by the developers.},

abstract = {Massive online courses occupy an important place in the educational landscape of today. We study an approach to scale predictive analytic models derived from online course discussion fora--specifically that of confusion detection--onto other courses. The primary challenge here is the lack of labeled examples in a new course and this calls for unsupervised domain adaptation (DA). As a first step in exploring DA in the education domain, we propose a simple algorithm, DiAd, which adapts a classifier trained on a course with labeled data by selectively choosing instances from a new course (with no labeled data) that are most dissimilar to the course with labeled data and on which the classifier is very confident of classification. Our algorithm is empirically validated on the confusion detection task across multiple online courses. We find that DiAd outperforms other methods on the target domain, while showing a comparable performance to a popular method that uses labeled data from the target domain.},

We combine best practices from the domains of artificial intelligence, machine learning, user experience engineering, ethics research, and cognitive science with state-of-the-art insights for multi-modal system development to create a cognitive action assistance system that recognizes and adapts to individual users in various situational contexts, such as picking and training.Proven work and organizational psychology methods and worth-related evaluations will accompany the system introduction into working environments. Using user- and worth-centred system design and change management strategies (e.g. information and participation) right from the beginning of such a technological development facilitates proper involvement of future users in the development process. This can lead to better congruence of technology features with workers' requirements and positively shape future users' attitudes towards the system.},

There are several references in the text for further logistic reform in universities via data mining (DM) algorithms concerning logistic entities and autonomous colleges, which examine the market features and interaction between them. The logistics service data mining (LS-DM) approach plays a critical role in advancing logistic management science while boosting the economy's overall benefits when used with other measures. As a result of the rapid popularization of higher education, new features and models place an even greater demand on logistics management in colleges and universities. Refined management must be advocated and implemented in the new scenario. To apply refined management, you must alter your management philosophy, fine-tune your rules and regulations, enhance performance capabilities, and put mechanisms for monitoring and assessing progress. As a result, logistics management can be continuously improved, students and teachers receive better and more gratifying services, and the scientific growth of colleges and universities may be laid solidly.. The proposed LS-DM system with logistics service, data mining, and machine learning model demonstrates simulation outcomes with an accuracy of 89.7% and a precision of 87.8%, which is greater than the accuracy and precision exhibited by the existing models.},

abstract = {Multimedia technology incorporates into the educational arena to translate traditional educational material into interactive digital mode. This has permitted teachers into the learning environment to design and integrate interactive multimedia learning. Many problems towards giving more attention to students facing teacher's multimedia levels are uneven, and their integration significance, bringing enormous curriculum learning strategies, is not entirely apparent. This research introduces multimedia network interpretation teaching using machine learning (MNIT-ML)in multimedia education design to enhance and strengthen the traditional teaching process and promote various modern approaches to transmit knowledge towards students.Allocation of learning resources (ALR) framework is mainly to enlarge the use and utilization of materials for learning activities from impressed resources into recordings, video content, motion graphics, and other forms of resources. The purpose of the Allocation of Learning Resources (ALR) framework is to aid teachers in making sound decisions about how to distribute available educational materials. Its goal is to guide teachers in making smart choices about how to use limited resources like time, money, and technology in order to improve students' educational achievements.The ALR framework was picked because it offers a methodical strategy for selecting choices that is founded in educational research and best practices. Resource allocation is a key aspect in influencing student outcomes, and efficient allocation can help guarantee that all students have access to the tools they need to succeed.There are a number of alternative frameworks that might direct studies on the distribution of educational resources. The Technological Acceptance Model (TAM) is a common tool for analysing what factors lead to widespread implementation of educational technology.The goal of other frameworks like the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework is to help educators create lessons and methods that are inclusive of students of all backgrounds and abilities.The final decision on which framework to use will be determined by the nature of the research issues and the setting in which they are being investigated. In order to make educated decisions, it is crucial to pick a framework that is appropriate for the research issues at hand and that gives a systematic approach based on established educational best practices. The digital promoting resources for teaching (DPRT) method creates a real environment for students to learn, focusing on enhancing training to make students feel the standard language translation skills. The simulation analysis is performed based on security 94.6%, the performance of 95.9%, and privacy, proving the proposed framework's reliability overall ratio of 93.4%.},

abstract = {Evaluation in empirical computer science is essential to show progress and assess technologies developed. Several research domains such as information retrieval have long relied on systematic evaluation to measure progress: here, the Cranfield paradigm of creating shared test collections, defining search tasks, and collecting ground truth for these tasks has persisted up until now. In recent years, however, several new challenges have emerged that do not fit this paradigm very well: extremely large data sets, confidential data sets as found in the medical domain, and rapidly changing data sets as often encountered in industry. Crowdsourcing has also changed the way in which industry approaches problem-solving with companies now organizing challenges and handing out monetary awards to incentivize people to work on their challenges, particularly in the field of machine learning.This article is based on discussions at a workshop on Evaluation-as-a-Service (EaaS). EaaS is the paradigm of not providing data sets to participants and have them work on the data locally, but keeping the data central and allowing access via Application Programming Interfaces (API), Virtual Machines (VM), or other possibilities to ship executables. The objectives of this article are to summarize and compare the current approaches and consolidate the experiences of these approaches to outline the next steps of EaaS, particularly toward sustainable research infrastructures.The article summarizes several existing approaches to EaaS and analyzes their usage scenarios and also the advantages and disadvantages. The many factors influencing EaaS are summarized, and the environment in terms of motivations for the various stakeholders, from funding agencies to challenge organizers, researchers and participants, to industry interested in supplying real-world problems for which they require solutions.EaaS solves many problems of the current research environment, where data sets are often not accessible to many researchers. Executables of published tools are equally often not available making the reproducibility of results impossible. EaaS, however, creates reusable/citable data sets as well as available executables. Many challenges remain, but such a framework for research can also foster more collaboration between researchers, potentially increasing the speed of obtaining research results.},

abstract = {The increasing reliance on group decision-making in today's complex business environments and advances in microcomputer, telecommunications and graphic presentation technology have combined to create a growing interest in the design of group decision support systems (GDSS). Planning is an important group decision-making activity within organizations. Effective planning depends on the generation and analysis of innovative ideas. For this reason, the idea generation and management process has been chosen as the domain for the study of the design and implementation of a GDSS to support complex, unstructured group decision processes within organizations.The MIS Planning and Decision Laboratory has been constructed to provide a research facility for the study of the planning and decision process while top executives from a variety of organizations use the laboratory to conduct actual planning sessions for their organization. This paper presents the design of a system to support the idea generation and analysis process in organization planning. Results of research conducted in the MIS Planning and Decision Laboratory on the use of the Electronic Brainstorming system with over 100 planners from a variety of organizations are presented and discussed.The findings of the research indicate that computer brainstorming stimulates task oriented behavior, decreases group interactions and equalizes participation. Information presentation, network speed and typing skills of the upper level managers were identified as possible inhibitors of the idea generation process that must be considered in the design of the system and the methodology for its use. Planners using the GDSS reported high levels of satisfaction with the process and outcome of the planning sessions. They rated the computer as an important tool for idea generation and the computer brainstorming process as "Much Better" than manual brainstorming.},

abstract = {Traditionally decisions made based on simulation models have been the outcomes of complicated statistical analyses and having confidence in them is a subjective matter. Hybrid simulation offers an improved approach to better model real life systems and increase confidence in their outcomes. In particular hybrid discrete-continuous simulation has the potentials to reduce the impact of statistics in building models in addition to other significant benefits. In this paper we use hybrid models of discrete-event simulation and system dynamics to analyze global supply chain decisions. And to increase the decision makers' confidence as well as to make use of their experiences we apply the Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP) analysis to the simulation results in order to reach better decisions. We describe the benefits of the use of the hybrid simulation and the added advantages of using AHP in order to maximize shareholder value.},

abstract = {In this paper we suggest a model for estimating performance of human organizations and business processes. This model is based on subjective assessment of the capabilities of the available human resources, the importance of these capabilities, and the influence of the peripheral factors on the resources. The model can be used to compare different resource allocation schemes in order to choose the most beneficial one. We suggest an extension to Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) by including performance measure of performers and the probability by which an outgoing Sequence Flow from a Gateway is chosen. We also propose an analytical method for estimating the overall performance of BPMN in simple cases and a simulation method, which can be used for more complicated scenarios. To illustrate how these methods work, we apply them to part of a military Operational Planning Process and discuss the results.},

abstract = {Since the 1950's, psychologists have studied the behavioral aspects of software engineering. However, the results of their research have never been organized into a subfield of either software engineering or psychology. This failure results from the difficulty of integrating theory and data from the mixture of paradigms borrowed from psychology. This paper will review some of the psychological research on software engineering performed since the Garmisch Conference in 1968. This review will be organized under two of the psychological paradigms used in exploring programming problems: individual differences and cognitive science. The major theoretical and practical contributions of each area to the theory and practice of software engineering will be discussed. The review will end with a call for more research guided by the paradigm of cognitive science, since such results are the easiest to integrate with new developments in artificial intelligence and computer science theory.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel method of estimating verbal expressions of task and social cohesion by quantifying the dynamic alignment of nonverbal behaviors in speech. As team cohesion has been linked to team effectiveness and productivity, automatically estimating team cohesion can be a useful tool for assessing meeting quality and broader team functioning. In total, more than 20 hours of business meetings (3-8 people) were recorded and annotated for behavioral indicators of group cohesion, distinguishing between social and task cohesion. We hypothesized that behaviors commonly referred to as mimicry can be indicative of verbal expressions of social and task cohesion. Where most prior work targets mimicry of dyads, we investigated the effectiveness of quantifying group-level phenomena. A dynamic approach was adopted in which both the cohesion expressions and the paralinguistic mimicry were quantified on small time windows. By extracting features solely related to the alignment of paralinguistic speech behavior, we found that 2-minute high and low social cohesive regions could be classified with a 0.71 Area under the ROC curve, performing on par with the state-of-the-art where turn-taking features were used. Estimating task cohesion was more challenging, obtaining an accuracy of 0.64 AUC, outperforming the state-of-the-art. Our results suggest that our proposed methodology is successful in quantifying group-level paralinguistic mimicry. As both the state-of-the-art turn-taking features and mimicry features performed worse on estimating task cohesion, we conclude that social cohesion is more openly expressed by nonverbal vocal behavior than task cohesion.},

abstract = {Crowdworkers depend on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) as an important source of income and it is left to workers to determine which tasks on AMT are fair and worth completing. While there are existing tools that assist workers in making these decisions, workers still spend significant amounts of time finding fair labor. Difficulties in this process may be a contributing factor in the imbalance between the median hourly earnings ($2.00/hour) and what the average requester pays ($11.00/hour). In this paper, we study how novices and experts select what tasks are worth doing. We argue that differences between the two populations likely lead to the wage imbalances. For this purpose, we first look at workers' comments in TurkOpticon (a tool where workers share their experience with requesters on AMT). We use this study to start to unravel what fair labor means for workers. In particular, we identify the characteristics of labor that workers consider is of "good quality'' and labor that is of "poor quality'' (e.g., work that pays too little.) Armed with this knowledge, we then conduct an experiment to study how experts and novices rate tasks that are of both good and poor quality. Through our research we uncover that experts and novices both treat good quality labor in the same way. However, there are significant differences in how experts and novices rate poor quality labor, and whether they believe the poor quality labor is worth doing. This points to several future directions, including machine learning models that support workers in detecting poor quality labor, and paths for educating novice workers on how to make better labor decisions on AMT.},

abstract = {Scientific impact is commonly associated with the number of citations received. However, an author can easily boost his own citation count by (i) publishing articles that cite his own previous work (self-citations), (ii) having co-authors citing his work (co-author citations), or (iii) exchanging citations with authors from other research groups (reciprocated citations). Even though these friendly citations inflate an author's perceived scientific impact, author ranking algorithms do not normally address them. They, at most, remove self-citations. Here we present Friends-Only Citations AnalySer (FOCAS), a method that identifies friendly citations and reduces their negative effect in author ranking algorithms. FOCAS combines the author citation network with the co-authorship network in order to measure author proximity and penalises citations between friendly authors. FOCAS is general and can be regarded as an independent module applied while running (any) PageRank-like author ranking algorithm. FOCAS can be tuned to use three different criteria, namely authors' distance, citation frequency, and citation recency, or combinations of these. We evaluate and compare FOCAS against eight state-of-the-art author ranking algorithms. We compare their rankings with a ground-truth of best paper awards. We test our hypothesis on a citation and co-authorship network comprised of seven Information Retrieval top-conferences. We observed that FOCAS improved author rankings by 25% on average and, in one case, leads to a gain of 46%.},

Many past research has explored the benefits of quantifying face-to-face interactions for informed workplace management, however to date, little attention has been paid to understand how the feedback on interaction behaviour is perceived at a personal scale. In this paper, we offer a reflection on the automated feedback of personal interactions in a workplace through a longitudinal study. We designed and developed a mobile system that captured, modelled, quantified and visualised face-to-face interactions of 47 employees for 4 months in an industrial research lab in Europe. Then we conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 employees to understand their perception and experience with the system. Our findings suggest that the short-term feedback on personal face-to-face interactions was not perceived as an effective external cue to promote self-reflection and that employees desire long-term feedback annotated with actionable attributes. Our findings provide a set of implications for the designers of future workplace technology and also opens up avenues for future HCI research on promoting self-reflection among employees.},

In the context of the legal domain, this could be in the form of analyzing large databases of legal cases, their facts and their claims, to answer questions such as: Do the current facts warrant litigation?, Is the litigation best pursued before a judge or a jury?, How long is it likely to take?, and What are the best strategies to use for achieving the most favorable outcome for the client? In this work, we report on research directed at answering such questions. We use one of a set of jury verdicts databases totaling nearly a half-million records. At the same time, we conduct a series of experiments that answer key questions and build, sequentially, a powerful data-driven legal decision support system, one that can assist an attorney to differentiate more effective from less effective legal principles and strategies. Ultimately, it represents a productivity tool that can help a litigation attorney make the most prudent decisions for his or her client.},

How should that firm allocate cheap but noisy resume screenings and expensive but in-depth in-person interviews? We view this problem through the lens of combinatorial pure exploration (CPE) in the multi-armed bandit setting, where a central learning agent performs costly exploration of a set of arms before selecting a final subset with some combinatorial structure. We generalize a recent CPE algorithm to the setting where arm pulls can have different costs and return different levels of information. We then prove theoretical upper bounds for a general class of arm-pulling strategies in this new setting. We apply our general algorithm to a real-world problem with combinatorial structure: incorporating diversity into university admissions. We take real data from admissions at one of the largest US-based computer science graduate programs and show that a simulation of our algorithm produces a cohort with hiring overall utility while spending comparable budget to the current admissions process at that university.},

abstract = {The problem of planning drainage services in a certain timeframe by a typical municipal infrastructure maintenance organization lends itself well to existing solutions for resource constrained project scheduling optimization. However, the optimized schedule could be deemed insufficient from a practitioner's perspective as the very crucial soft constraint on the competence of a particular crew handling different jobs is excluded. We define a crew-job matching index ranging from 0 to 1 to allow for a planner's assessment to be factored in job schedule simulation and optimization. The total crew-job matching index (TCJMI) is further defined, accounting for all the crew-job assignments and indicating the fitness of a formulated plan. TCJMI is maximized in the resource-constrained schedule optimization by applying Excel Solver add-in. As such, the planner's preference and experience can be represented and factored in crew-job scheduling optimization, which is demonstrated through conducting "what-if" simulation scenario analyses.},

abstract = {With the tremendous development of AI technologies, people will increasingly encounter software algorithms that supervise their work. Algorithmic management is the term for AI that performs the functions traditionally reserved for human managers (hiring, firing, providing evaluative feedback, and setting compensation). Although such algorithms indisputably perform management functions, they are often framed as support tools that facilitate worker autonomy. Perceptions of autonomy can enhance productivity, especially when the work holds intrinsic meaning for workers. But crowdwork often seems meaningless. More problematically, the meaning of the work must sometimes be obscured due to reasons of security or experimental control (when the workers serve as subjects in a psychological experiment). In this paper, we conduct an online experiment (N=560) to investigate how autonomy-perceptions and the meaningfulness of work interact to shape crowdworker motivation. As predicted, we find that workers are motivated when their work has meaning and algorithmic management is framed in a way that makes worker autonomy salient. However, when work holds no meaning, we find productivity is enhanced when algorithms are framed in a way that makes algorithm control salient. We also find evidence that providing meaning to the work can introduce systematic biases in crowdworker responses that could undermine accuracy in certain contexts.},

During the Gold Rush period of the 19th Century, Melbourne was the richest city in the world, and as a result it is filled with many unique neighborhoods and distinctive buildings. In addition to wonderful neighborhoods to explore, the city has great museums and other cultural attractions, as well as a fine multi-cultural atmosphere. For those who would like to explore the outdoors, popular highlights are the Phillip Island Nature Park (90 minutes away), which features wild penguins who return in a parade each day at sunset, and the Great Ocean Road, one of the world's most scenic coastal drives, including the famous towering 12 Apostles.SIGMOD 2015's exciting technical program reflects not only traditional topics, but the database community's role in broader data science and data analytics. The keynote from Laura Haas, "The Power Behind the Throne: Information Integration in the Age of Data-Driven Discovery" highlights the role of database and data integration techniques in the growing field of data science. Jignesh Patel's talk, "From Data to Insights @ Bare Metal Speed," explains how hardware and software need to be co-evolved to support the needs of scalable data analytics. Jennifer Widom, winner of the 2015 ACM-W Athena Lecturer Award for fundamental contributions to computer science, will give her award talk, "Three Favorite Results," on Tuesday. Christopher R\'{e} will lead a panel on "Machine Learning and Databases: The Sound of Things to Come or a Cacophony of Hype?," with participants Divyakant Agrawal, Magdalena Balazinska, Michael Cafarella, Michael Jordan, Tim Kraska, and Raghu Ramakrishnan. Of course, there are also 106 research paper presentations, 4 tutorials, 30 demonstrations, and 18 industrial papers. Papers will be presented both as talks during the research sessions, and as part of plenary Poster Sessions.SIGMOD 2015 is preceded by the PhD Workshop, as well as workshops on leading-edge topics like data analytics (DanaC), databases and the Web (WebDB), exploratory search (ExploreDB), managing and mining spatial data (GeoRich), and graph data (GRADES); the New Researcher Symposium will take place on Wednesday. The banquet will be held in a Melbourne landmark, the Town Hall.As in recent years, we had two submission deadlines for SIGMOD this year, one in August and one in November. The review process was journal-style, with multiple rounds of reviews coordinated by the Group Leaders. We accepted 34 of 137 papers from the first deadline and 72 of 278 from the second deadline. The total acceptance rate was about 25.5%, and we believe that the revision processhas improved the quality of the technical program.},

abstract = {AI is widely thought to be poised to transform business, yet current perceptions of the scope of this transformation may be myopic. Recent progress in natural language processing involving transformer language models (TLMs) offers a potential avenue for AI-driven business and societal transformation that is beyond the scope of what most currently foresee. We review this recent progress as well as recent literature utilizing text mining in top IS journals to develop an outline for how future IS research can benefit from these new techniques. Our review of existing IS literature reveals that suboptimal text mining techniques are prevalent and that the more advanced TLMs could be applied to enhance and increase IS research involving text data, and to enable new IS research topics, thus creating more value for the research community. This is possible because these techniques make it easier to develop very powerful custom systems and their performance is superior to existing methods for a wide range of tasks and applications. Further, multilingual language models make possible higher quality text analytics for research in multiple languages. We also identify new avenues for IS research, like language user interfaces, that may offer even greater potential for future IS research.},

abstract = {In order to speed up spreadsheet development productivity, end users can create a spreadsheet table by copying and modifying an existing one. These two tables share the similar computational semantics, and form a table clone. End users may modify the tables in a table clone, e.g., adding new rows and deleting columns, thus introducing structure changes into the table clone. Our empirical study on real-world spreadsheets shows that about 58.5% of table clones involve structure changes. However, existing table clone detection approaches in spreadsheets can only detect table clones with the same structures. Therefore, many table clones with structure changes cannot be detected. We observe that, although the tables in a table clone may be modified, they usually share the similar structures and formats, e.g., headers, formulas and background colors. Based on this observation, we propose LTC (Learning to detect Table Clones), to automatically detect table clones with or without structure changes. LTC utilizes the structure and format information from labeled table clones and non table clones to train a binary classifier. LTC first identifies tables in spreadsheets, and then uses the trained binary classifier to judge whether every two tables can form a table clone. Our experiments on real-world spreadsheets from the EUSES and Enron corpora show that, LTC can achieve a precision of 97.8% and recall of 92.1% in table clone detection, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art technique (a precision of 37.5% and recall of 11.1%).},

Evaluators may have questions about test recordings, but have no way of asking them. Interactive conversational assistants provide a Q&amp;A dynamic that may improve analysis efficiency and evaluator autonomy. To understand the full range of analysis-related questions, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz design probe study with 20 participants who interacted with simulated AI assistants via text or voice. We found that participants asked for five categories of information: user actions, user mental model, help from the AI assistant, product and task information, and user demographics. Those who used the text assistant asked more questions, but the question lengths were similar. The text assistant was perceived as significantly more efficient, but both were rated equally in satisfaction and trust. We also provide design considerations for future conversational AI assistants for UX evaluation.},

abstract = {Inter-team knowledge sharing is an important aspect of agile software development because it allows agility to be scaled to an entire organization. However, achieving inter-team knowledge sharing is not easy because the practices that allow it to happen are poorly reported In The literature. As a consequence, many Agile Software organizations find It difficult to share Experiences and best practices in their contexts, as well as improve employees' skills and expertise. Results from our previous qualitative Studies enabled us to generate A pattern language that aims to help agile Software organizations to adopt practices for fostering interaction among Agile teams in order to share knowledge Across teams and create collective knowledge. This paper contributes to the Agile Software development and knowledge management fields with practical guidance to organizations aiming those Improvements. "Because of space limitations, we describe only five patterns of the pattern language In This paper, which are briefly presented as follows. Open Workspace helps to stimulate face-to-face conversations across teams. Rotation of Teams' Members is a practice about transferring of professionals to other teams in order to spread technical, methodological and management solutions in a sustainable way. Pair Programming among Different Teams are specially adopted to level technical knowledge throughout the company. Collective Meetings foster inter-team communication and alignment about company's projects and goals. Finally, Technical Presentations Stimulate continuous learning and knowledge sharing behaviour. It is important to note that the adoption of the pattern language is affected by forces, such as organizational culture, environment, and top management and leadership support. These forces need to balanced to facilitate and/or reinforce the patterns.},

But it is also possible that crowd work will fail to achieve its potential, focusing on assembly-line piecework. Can we foresee a future crowd workplace in which we would want our children to participate? This paper frames the major challenges that stand in the way of this goal. Drawing on theory from organizational behavior and distributed computing, as well as direct feedback from workers, we outline a framework that will enable crowd work that is complex, collaborative, and sustainable. The framework lays out research challenges in twelve major areas: workflow, task assignment, hierarchy, real-time response, synchronous collaboration, quality control, crowds guiding AIs, AIs guiding crowds, platforms, job design, reputation, and motivation.},

Our study highlights that, with the exception of crowdsourcing relevance judgments, very few studies have investigated the application of gamification to search systems. Moreover, in articles that we would strictly define as being related to gamification (i.e. not games with a purpose or serious games), a majority did not present any real-world systems, user studies or empirical results. In numerous other fields, gamification has been used to successfully increase user engagement and productivity. We argue that the potential of gamification has been overlooked in information retrieval and, in particular, in interactive search settings. We conclude by discussing experimental obstacles and the potential benefits of evaluating gamification strategies in future interactive search systems.},

However, most AI-infused systems apply fully automatic approaches, leading to distrust from UX evaluators. In my dissertation work, we consider AI as assisting, not replacing human judgment. Through an international survey, we investigated the current practices and challenges of UX evaluators and identified an opportunity for AI assistance. We then studied nuanced cooperative work between UX evaluators and AI, by employing either non-interactive visualizations or interactive conversational assistants (CAs). The next steps include building upon our findings about the reactive Q&amp;A dynamic with CAs, by exploring how a proactive approach or a combination of visualizations and CAs may better support UX evaluators. This research will identify interactions and representations that give rise to productive and trusting collaborations with AI.},

abstract = {It has been found that the perceived appeal (or aesthetic) of an interface plays important role in determining its usability. Predictive model of interface aesthetics can thus be useful for designer to determine and improve usability. Images being an integral part of most of the interfaces contribute significantly to the overall interface aesthetics. In this paper, we propose a computational model to predict the aesthetic quality of on-screen images. We have identified a total of twenty features, divided into two broad categories, to capture image aesthetics. In order to relate the features to aesthetics, we performed a controlled user study with eighty images and hundred participants. The images were created by us and the participants were asked to rate those on a 5-point scale as per their judgment of appeal (or beauty or aesthetics) of the images. The data were used to train and test a non-linear regression model based on a SVM classifier, as the predictor of image aesthetics, with a mean square error of 0.03. The model basically predicts the likely aesthetic rating (on a 5-point scale) for a given image, given the feature values. The proposed model along with the details of the empirical data collection and analysis are discussed in this paper.},

We rely on SCCs as a nexus between a seemingly infinite number of ordinances and tweets to be able to map them, and also to facilitate SCC-based opinion mining later for providing feedback to urban agencies based on public reactions. Common sense knowledge is harnessed in our approach to reflect human judgment in mapping. This paper presents our research in ordinance and tweet mapping with SCCs, including the proposed mapping approach, our initial experiments, related discussion, and future work emerging therein. To the best of our knowledge, ours is among the first works to conduct mining on ordinances and tweets for Smart Cities. This work has a broader impact with a vision to enhance Smart City growth.},

Medical imaging techniques hold the promise of relating cognition to physical activities and brain structures. In a controlled experiment involving 29 participants, we examine code comprehension, code review and prose review using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We find that the neural representations of programming languages vs. natural languages are distinct. We can classify which task a participant is under-taking based solely on brain activity (balanced accuracy 79%, p &lt; 0.001). Further, we find that the same set of brain regions distinguish between code and prose (near-perfect correlation, r = 0.99, p &lt; 0.001). Finally, we find that task distinctions are modulated by expertise, such that greater skill predicts a less differentiated neural representation (r = −0.44, p = 0.016) indicating that more skilled participants treat code and prose more similarly at a neural activation level.},

It will bring about orders of magnitude improvements in efficiency, performance, reliability, security, and productivity in the design and programming of systems of artificial intelligence that incorporate Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). In addition, it will solve a causality problem for organizations who lack access to Data and Models. Its open software architecture will facilitate adoption of the whole concept on a wider scale. To evaluate the effectiveness, technical feasibility, and to quantify the real-world improvements in efficiency, security, performance, effort and cost of adding AI to products and services using the Bonseyes platform, four complementary demonstrators will be built. Bonseyes platform capabilities are aimed at being aligned with the European FI-PPP activities and take advantage of its flagship project FIWARE.

abstract = {Pair programming has a documented history of benefits, such as increased code quality, productivity, self-efficacy, knowledge transfer, and reduced gender gap. Research uncovered problems with pair programming related to scheduling, collocating, role imbalance, and power dynamics. We investigated the trade-offs of substituting a human with an agent to simultaneously provide benefits and alleviate obstacles in pair programming. We conducted gender-balanced studies with human-human pairs in a remote lab with 18 programmers and Wizard-of-Oz studies with 14 programmers, then analyzed results quantitatively and qualitatively. Our comparative analysis of the two studies showed no significant differences in productivity, code quality, and self-efficacy. Further, agents facilitated knowledge transfer; however, unlike humans, agents were unable to provide logical explanations or discussions. Human partners trusted and showed humility towards agents. Our results demonstrate that agents can act as effective pair programming partners and open the way towards new research on conversational agents for programming.},

abstract = {Online communities are successful only if they achieve their goals, but there has been little direct study of goals. We analyze novel data characterizing the goals of enterprise online communities, assessing the importance of goals for leaders, how goals influence member perceptions of community value, and how goals relate to success measures proposed in the literature. We find that most communities have multiple goals and common goals are learning, reuse of resources, collaboration, networking, influencing change, and innovation. Leaders and members agree that all of these goals are important, but their perceptions of success on goals do not align with each other, or with commonly used behavioral success measures. We conclude that simple behavioral measures and leader perceptions are not good success metrics, and propose alternatives based on specific goals members and leaders judge most important.},

abstract = {This article attempts to bridge the gap between widely discussed ethical principles of Human-centered AI (HCAI) and practical steps for effective governance. Since HCAI systems are developed and implemented in multiple organizational structures, I propose 15 recommendations at three levels of governance: team, organization, and industry. The recommendations are intended to increase the reliability, safety, and trustworthiness of HCAI systems: (1) reliable systems based on sound software engineering practices, (2) safety culture through business management strategies, and (3) trustworthy certification by independent oversight. Software engineering practices within teams include audit trails to enable analysis of failures, software engineering workflows, verification and validation testing, bias testing to enhance fairness, and explainable user interfaces. The safety culture within organizations comes from management strategies that include leadership commitment to safety, hiring and training oriented to safety, extensive reporting of failures and near misses, internal review boards for problems and future plans, and alignment with industry standard practices. The trustworthiness certification comes from industry-wide efforts that include government interventions and regulation, accounting firms conducting external audits, insurance companies compensating for failures, non-governmental and civil society organizations advancing design principles, and professional organizations and research institutes developing standards, policies, and novel ideas. The larger goal of effective governance is to limit the dangers and increase the benefits of HCAI to individuals, organizations, and society.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency is an important criterion to judge the quality of mobile apps, but one third of our arbitrarily sampled apps suffer from energy issues that can quickly drain battery power. To understand these issues, we conduct an empirical study on 36 well-maintained apps such as Chrome and Firefox, whose issue tracking systems are publicly accessible. Our study involves issue causes, manifestation, fixing efforts, detection techniques, reasons of no-fixes, and debugging techniques. Inspired by the empirical study, we propose a novel testing framework for detecting energy issues in real-world mobile apps. Our framework examines apps with well-designed input sequences and runtime context. We develop leading edge technologies, e.g., pre-designing input sequences with potential energy overuse and tuning tests on-the-fly, to achieve high efficacy in detecting energy issues. A large-scale evaluation shows that 90.4% of the detected issues in our experiments were previously unknown to developers. On average, these issues can double the energy consumption of the test cases where the issues were detected. And our test achieves a low number of false positives. Finally, we show how our test reports can help developers fix the issues.},

In this paper we examine 18.8 million question and answer pairs from Jisiklog, the largest mobile pay-foranswer Q&amp;A service in Korea, and the results of a complementary survey study of 245 Jisiklog workers. The data are used to investigate key motivators of participation, working strategies of experienced users, and longitudinal interaction dynamics. We find that answerers are rarely motivated by social factors but are motivated by financial incentives and intrinsic motives. Additionally, although answers are provided quickly, an answerer's topic selection tends to be broad, with experienced workers employing unique strategies to answer questions and judge relevance. Finally, analysis of longitudinal working patterns and community dynamics demonstrate the robustness of mobile pay-for-answer Q&amp;A.

abstract = {With computational algorithms making an increasing number of deeply consequential, and often problematic judgments on our behalf, there is a growing interest in slowing down technology to encourage users to reflect on judgments made by algorithms. Prior work in slow technology has established slowness as an agent of reflection and serendipity; however, it has been unclear whether this waiting time actually helps users gain useful insight or any other benefits as they make judgments using an algorithm. To this end, we conducted a series of online and in-person between-subject user studies in which we isolate the impact of an algorithm's speed on how users incorporate the algorithm's advice when making judgments in the context of simple visual recognition tasks. We find that our participants followed good quality algorithms more and bad quality algorithms somewhat less if the response time of the algorithm is slower. Furthermore, qualitative analysis of the in-person study interviews reveals that the waiting was not time wasted, but was often used to reflect on the task and the estimation process of themselves and the algorithm, and to compare and reevaluate the two processes. Based on these findings, we outline design implications of future algorithmic systems.},

abstract = {Emotions (e.g., Joy, Anger) are prevalent in daily software engineering (SE) activities, and are known to be significant indicators of work productivity (e.g., bug fixing efficiency). Recent studies have shown that directly applying general purpose emotion classification tools to SE corpora is not effective. Even within the SE domain, tool performance degrades significantly when trained on one communication channel and evaluated on another (e.g, StackOverflow vs. GitHub comments). Retraining a tool with channel-specific data takes significant effort since manually annotating a large dataset of ground truth data is expensive. In this paper, we address this data scarcity problem by automatically creating new training data using a data augmentation technique. Based on an analysis of the types of errors made by popular SE-specific emotion recognition tools, we specifically target our data augmentation strategy in order to improve the performance of emotion recognition. Our results show an average improvement of 9.3% in micro F1-Score for three existing emotion classification tools (ESEM-E, EMTk, SEntiMoji) when trained with our best augmentation strategy.},

We iterated PairBuddy’s design using a series of Wizard-of-Oz studies. Our pilot study of six programmers showed promising results and provided insights toward PairBuddy’s interface design. Our second study of 14 programmers was positively praised across all skill levels. PairBuddy’s active application of soft skills—adaptability, motivation, and social presence—as a navigator increased participants’ confidence and trust, while its technical skills—code contributions, just-in-time feedback, and creativity support—as a driver helped participants realize their own solutions.

This paper describes the planning, execution and evaluation of a socialization regime for an online technical support community. In a two-phase project, we first automatically identified from participants' early behavior, those with high potential to become core members. We then designed, delivered and experimentally evaluated socialization experiences intended to build commitment and competence among these potential core members. We were able to identify potential core members with high accuracy from only two weeks of behavior. A year later, those classified as potential core members participated in the community ten times more actively than those not identified. In an evaluation experiment, some potential core members were randomly assigned to receive socialization experiences, while others were not. A year later, those who had participated in the socialization regime contributed more answers in the community compared to those in the control condition. The socialization experiences, however, undercut their sense of connection to the community and the quality of their contributions. We discuss what was effective and what could be improved in designing socialization experiences for online groups.},

abstract = {Background: Some developer activity traditionally performed manually, such as making code commits, opening, managing, or closing issues is increasingly subject to automation in many OSS projects. Specifically, such activity is often performed by tools that react to events or run at specific times. We refer to such automation tools as bots and, in many software mining scenarios related to developer productivity or code quality, it is desirable to identify bots in order to separate their actions from actions of individuals. Aim: Find an automated way of identifying bots and code committed by these bots, and to characterize the types of bots based on their activity patterns. Method and Result: We propose BIMAN, a systematic approach to detect bots using author names, commit messages, files modified by the commit, and projects associated with the commits. For our test data, the value for AUC-ROC was 0.9. We also characterized these bots based on the time patterns of their code commits and the types of files modified, and found that they primarily work with documentation files and web pages, and these files are most prevalent in HTML and JavaScript ecosystems. We have compiled a shareable dataset containing detailed information about 461 bots we found (all of which have more than 1000 commits) and 13,762,430 commits they created.},

Record numbers of jobs previously held by people have been automated, from manufacturing to transportation to customer services. The concerns of AI replacing humans by taking over people's jobs need to be urgently addressed. This article investigates some promising different directions of AI development: Instead of using AI to replace people, we should use AI to team up with people so that both can work better and smarter. Human–AI symbiosis refers to people and AI working together to jointly solve problems and perform specific tasks. The recent developments in deep learning models and frameworks have significantly improved the efficiency and performance of human and AI collaborations. In this article, some research work on human–AI collaborative environments has been extensively studied and analyzed to reveal the progress in this field. Although the teaming of humans and machines includes many complex tasks, the development has been very promising. One of the main goals in this field is to develop additional capabilities in machines capable of being successful teammates with a human partner. The correctness of the outcomes is often determined by the underlying technology and how performance and human satisfaction are measured through the collaborative nature of the system. We conclude that the teaming of humans and AI, particularly deep learning, has the advantage of combining the power of AI with the human domain expertise to improve performance and create value. Human–AI symbiosis could be a promising future direction for AI's continuing integration into the world.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data, including web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents, and social media (such as blog articles, forum posts, product reviews, and tweets). This has led to an increasing demand for powerful software tools to help people manage and analyze vast amounts of text data effectively and efficiently. Unlike data generated by a computer system or sensors, text data are usually generated directly by humans, and capture semantically rich content. As such, text data are especially valuable for discovering knowledge about human opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. In contrast to structured data, which conform to well-defined schemas (thus are relatively easy for computers to handle), text has less explicit structure, requiring computer processing toward understanding of the content encoded in text. The current technology of natural language processing has not yet reached a point to enable a computer to precisely understand natural language text, but a wide range of statistical and heuristic approaches to management and analysis of text data have been developed over the past few decades. They are usually very robust and can be applied to analyze and manage text data in any natural language, and about any topic.This book provides a systematic introduction to many of these approaches, with an emphasis on covering the most useful knowledge and skills required to build a variety of practically useful text information systems. Because humans can understand natural languages far better than computers can, effective involvement of humans in a text information system is generally needed and text information systems often serve as intelligent assistants for humans. Depending on how a text information system collaborates with humans, we distinguish two kinds of text information systems. The first is information retrieval systems which include search engines and recommender systems; they assist users in finding from a large collection of text data the most relevant text data that are actually needed for solving a specific application problem, thus effecively turning big raw text data into much smaller relevant text data that can be more easily processed by humans. The second is text mining application systems; they can assist users in analyzing patterns in text data to extract and discover useful actionable knowledge directly useful for task completion or decision making, thus providing more direct task support for users. This book covers the major concepts, techniques, and ideas in information retrieval and text data mining from a practical viewpoint, and includes many hands-on exercises designed with a companion software toolkit (i.e., MeTA) to help readers learn how to apply techniques of information retrieval and text mining to real-world text data and how to experiment with and improve some of the algorithms for interesting application tasks. This book can be used as a textbook for computer science undergraduates and graduates, library and information scientists, or as a reference book for practitioners working on relevant problems in managing and analyzing text data.}

abstract = {Resource scarcity is a global challenge, especially in E-mobility. Currently, Electric vehicles (EVs) are considered as an attractive option on a pathway towards low emission mobility. Nevertheless, due to the increasing sales and acceptance of EVs, new challenges arise regarding the scarcity of utilized materials, especially regarding lithium-ion battery systems. Battery production is responsible for the major share of the environmental and economical impacts of the overall EV production. In order to tackle these challenges, resource-efficient processes and a circular use are necessary. Today, a variety of new Industry 4.0 technologies (such as high integrated production systems) are affordable and have reached maturity. Like Industry 4.0, also Recycling 4.0 aims at digitalization of processes but with the focus on the End of Life stage of products. The main goal of the German research project Recycling 4.0 is to develop approaches, which enable advanced information creation, transfer and use along the entire supply chain. In this work, a holistic approach towards an advanced circular economy (Recycling 4.0) is shown. This approach combines methods from different areas (such as economics, mechanical engineering, and computer science) and paves the way towards an advanced circular economy. This paper introduces this approach by discussing the current situation of EV recycling and related judicial fundamentals. Furthermore, the overall approach is introduced, and the discipline-specific sub-approaches are discussed in detail.},

Array programming unites two uncommon properties. As an abstraction, it directly mirrors mathematical concepts commonly used in many fields from natural sciences over engineering to financial modeling. As a language feature, it exposes regular control flow, exhibits structured data dependencies, and lends itself to many types of program analysis. Furthermore, many modern parallel computer architectures are well-suited to efficiently execute array operations. The ARRAY series of workshops explores all aspects of array programming, such as languages, formal semantics, array theories, productivity/performance tradeoffs, libraries, notation such as including axis- and index-based approaches, intermediate languages, and efficient compilation.},

abstract = {Software systems are decomposed hierarchically, for example, into modules, packages and files. This hierarchical decomposition has a profound influence on evolvability, maintainability and work assignment. Hierarchical decomposition is thus clearly of central concern for empirical software engineering researchers; but it also poses a quandary. At what level do we study phenomena, such as quality, distribution, collaboration and productivity? At the level of files? packages? or modules? How does the level of study affect the truth, meaning, and relevance of the findings? In other fields it has been found that choosing the wrong level might lead to misleading or fallacious results. Choosing a proper level, for study, is thus vitally important for empirical software engineering research; but this issue hasn't thus far been explicitly investigated. We describe the related idea of ecological inference and ecological fallacy from sociology and epidemiology, and explore its relevance to empirical software engineering; we also present some case studies, using defect and process data from 18 open source projects to illustrate the risks of modeling at an aggregation level in the context of defect prediction, as well as in hypothesis testing.},

The results of this study form the basis for the development of an "intelligent" noise protection headphone as part of Cyber Physical Production Systems, which provides auditorily augmented information to machine operators and enables radio communication between them. Further application areas are implementations in control rooms (equipped with multichannel loudspeaker systems) and utilization for training purposes. The focus of our research lies on situation-specific acoustic processing of conditioned machine sounds and operation related data with high information content, considering the often highly auditorily influenced working knowledge of skilled workers. As a proof-of-concept the data stream of error probability estimations regarding partly manipulated 3D printing processes was mapped to three sonification models, giving evidence about momentary operation states. The neural network applied indicates a high accuracy (&gt;93%) concerning error estimation distinguishing between normal and manipulated operation states. None of the manipulated states could be identified by listening. An auditory augmentation, respectively sonification of these error estimations provides a considerable benefit to process monitoring.},

abstract = {Designing interactive technology entails several objectives, one of which is identifying and selecting appropriate functionality. Given candidate functionalities such as “print,” “bookmark,” and “share,” a designer has to choose which functionalities to include and which to leave out. Such choices critically affect the acceptability, productivity, usability, and experience of the design. However, designers may overlook reasonable designs because there is an exponential number of functionality sets and multiple factors to consider. This article is the first to formally define this problem and propose an algorithmic method to support designers to explore alternative functionality sets in early stage design. Based on interviews of professional designers, we mathematically define the task of identifying functionality sets that strike the best balance among four objectives: usefulness, satisfaction, ease of use, and profitability. We develop an integer linear programming solution that can efficiently solve very large instances (set size over 1,300) on a regular computer. Further, we build on techniques of robust optimization to search for diverse and surprising functionality designs. Empirical results from a controlled study and field deployment are encouraging. Most designers rated computationally created sets to be of the comparable or superior quality than their own. Designers reported gaining better understanding of available functionalities and the design space.},

abstract = {Enterprises have recently adopted AI to human resource management (HRM) to evaluate employees’ work performance evaluation. However, in such an HRM context where multiple stakeholders are complexly intertwined with different incentives, it is problematic to design AI reflecting one stakeholder group's needs (e.g., enterprises, HR managers). Our research aims to investigate what tensions surrounding AI in HRM exist among stakeholders and explore design solutions to balance the tensions. By conducting stakeholder-centered participatory workshops with diverse stakeholders (including employees, employers/HR teams, and AI/business experts), we identified five major tensions: 1)&nbsp;divergent perspectives on fairness, 2)&nbsp;the accuracy of AI, 3)&nbsp;the transparency of the algorithm and its decision process, 4)&nbsp;the interpretability of algorithmic decisions, and 5)&nbsp;the trade-off between productivity and inhumanity. We present stakeholder-centered design ideas for solutions to mitigate these tensions and further discuss how to promote harmony among various stakeholders at the workplace.},

abstract = {As recently as 1968, computer scientists were uncertain how best to interconnect even two computers. The notion that within a few decades the challenge would be how to interconnect millions of computers around the globe was too far-fetched to contemplate. Yet, by 1988, that is precisely what was happening. The products and devices developed in the intervening years—such as modems, multiplexers, local area networks, and routers—became the linchpins of the global digital society. How did such revolutionary innovation occur? This book tells the story of the entrepreneurs who were able to harness and join two factors: the energy of computer science researchers supported by governments and universities, and the tremendous commercial demand for Internetworking computers. The centerpiece of this history comes from unpublished interviews from the late 1980s with over 80 computing industry pioneers, including Paul Baran, J.C.R. Licklider, Vint Cerf, Robert Kahn, Larry Roberts, and Robert Metcalfe. These individuals give us unique insights into the creation of multi-billion dollar markets for computer-communications equipment, and they reveal how entrepreneurs struggled with failure, uncertainty, and the limits of knowledge.“The key technologies that brought us our modern networked society—routers, packet switching, multiplexers, Internet protocols—were all invented by people in the short period between 1968 and 1988. James Pelkey interviewed these people at that time and recorded their stories. This book is the result: a detailed and up-close personal history of a world being born. Fascinating.” - W. Brian Arthur, Author of The Nature of Technology: What It Is and How It Evolves“Circuits, Packets, and Protocols is full of revelations for me even though I was there. Never had it explained so clearly how my distributed computing strategy was the wrong one for 3Com in the 1980s.” - Bob Metcalfe, Internet Pioneer, Ethernet inventor, 3Com founder; University of Texas at Austin Professor of Innovation}

abstract = {Implicit Requirements (IMR) identification is part of the Requirements Engineering (RE) phase in Software Engineering during which data is gathered to create SRS (Software Requirements Specifications) documents. As opposed to explicit requirements clearly stated, IMRs constitute subtle data and need to be inferred. Research has shown that IMRs are crucial to the success of software development. Many software systems can encounter failures due to lack of IMR data management. SRS documents are large, often hundreds of pages, due to which manually identifying IMRs by human software engineers is not feasible. Moreover, such data is evergrowing due to the expansion of software systems. It is thus important to address the crucial issue of IMR data management. This article presents a survey on IMRs in SRS documents with the definition and overview of IMR data, detailed taxonomy of IMRs with explanation and examples, practices in managing IMR data, and tools for IMR identification. In addition to reviewing classical and state-of-the-art approaches, we highlight trends and challenges and point out open issues for future research. This survey article is interesting based on data quality, hidden information retrieval, veracity and salience, and knowledge discovery from large textual documents with complex heterogeneous data.},

abstract = {This book demonstrates the need for and the value of interdisciplinary research in addressing important societal challenges associated with the widespread use of algorithmic decision-making. Algorithms are increasingly being used to make decisions in various domains such as criminal justice, medicine, and employment. While algorithmic tools have the potential to make decision-making more accurate, consistent, and transparent, they pose serious challenges to societal interests. For example, they can perpetuate discrimination, cause representational harm, and deny opportunities.The Societal Impacts of Algorithmic Decision-Making presents several contributions to the growing body of literature that seeks to respond to these challenges, drawing on techniques and insights from computer science, economics, and law. The author develops tools and frameworks to characterize the impacts of decision-making and incorporates models of behavior to reason about decision-making in complex environments. These technical insights are leveraged to deepen the qualitative understanding of the impacts of algorithms on problem domains including employment and lending.The social harms of algorithmic decision-making are far from being solved. While easy solutions are not presented here, there are actionable insights for those who seek to deploy algorithms responsibly. The research presented within this book will hopefully contribute to broader efforts to safeguard societal values while still taking advantage of the promise of algorithmic decision-making.}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a general framework that allows developers to filter, summarize and analyze user reviews written about applications on App Stores. Our framework extracts automatically relevant features from reviews of apps (e.g., information about functionalities, bugs, requirements, etc) and analyzes the sentiment associated with each of them. Our framework has three main building blocks, namely, (i) topic modeling, (ii) sentiment analysis and (iii) summarization interface. The topic modeling block aims at finding semantic topics from textual comments, extracting the target features based on the most relevant words of each discovered topic. The sentiment analysis block detects the sentiment associated with each discovered feature. The summarization interface provides to developers an intuitive visualization of the features (i.e., topics) and their associated sentiment, providing richer information than a 'star rating' strategy. Our evaluation shows that the topic modeling block is able to organize information provided by users in subcategories that facilitate the understanding of which features more positively/negatively impact the overall evaluation of the application. Regarding user satisfaction, we can observe that, in spite of the star rating being a good measure of evaluation, the Sentiment Analysis technique is more accurate in capturing the sentiment transmitted by the user by means of a comment.},

abstract = {Massive data from software repositories and collaboration tools are widely used to study social aspects in software development. One question that several recent works have addressed is how a software project's size and structure influence team productivity, a question famously considered in Brooks' law. Recent studies using massive repository data suggest that developers in larger teams tend to be less productive than smaller teams. Despite using similar methods and data, other studies argue for a positive linear or even super-linear relationship between team size and productivity, thus contesting the view of software economics that software projects are diseconomies of scale.In our work, we study challenges that can explain the disagreement between recent studies of developer productivity in massive repository data. We further provide, to the best of our knowledge, the largest, curated corpus of GitHub projects tailored to investigate the influence of team size and collaboration patterns on individual and collective productivity. Our work contributes to the ongoing discussion on the choice of productivity metrics in the operationalisation of hypotheses about determinants of successful software projects. It further highlights general pitfalls in big data analysis and shows that the use of bigger data sets does not automatically lead to more reliable insights.},

abstract = {Many smartphone apps collect potentially sensitive personal data and send it to cloud servers. However, most mobile users have a poor understanding of why their data is being collected. We present MobiPurpose, a novel technique that can take a network request made by an Android app and then classify the data collection purposes, as one step towards making it possible to explain to non-experts the data disclosure contexts. Our purpose inference works by leveraging two observations: 1) developer naming conventions (e.g., URL paths) of ten offer hints as to data collection purposes, and 2) external knowledge, such as app metadata and information about the domain name, are meaningful cues that can be used to infer the behavior of different traffic requests. MobiPurpose parses each traffic request body into key-value pairs, and infers the data type and data collection purpose of each key-value pair using a combination of supervised learning and text pattern bootstrapping. We evaluated MobiPurpose's effectiveness using a dataset cross-labeled by ten human experts. Our results show that MobiPurpose can predict the data collection purpose with an average precision of 84% (among 19 unique categories).},

abstract = {In the era of Industry 4.0, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) performs the driving position analogous to the initial industrial metamorphosis. IoT affords the potential to couple machine-to-machine intercommunication and real-time information-gathering within the industry domain. Hence, the enactment of IoT in the industry magnifies effective optimization, authority, and data-driven judgment. However, this field undergoes several interoperable issues, including large numbers of heterogeneous IoT gadgets, tools, software, sensing, and processing components, joining through the Internet, despite the deficiency of communication protocols and standards. Recently, various interoperable protocols, platforms, standards, and technologies are enhanced and altered according to the specifications of the applicability in industrial applications. However, there are no recent survey papers that primarily examine various interoperability issues that Industrial IoT (IIoT) faces. In this review, we investigate the conventional and recent developments of relevant state-of-the-art IIoT technologies, frameworks, and solutions for facilitating interoperability between different IIoT components. We also discuss several interoperable IIoT standards, protocols, and models for digitizing the industrial revolution. Finally, we conclude this survey with an inherent discussion of open challenges and directions for future research.},

In this paper, we discuss concerns and opportunities raised by AI-driven hiring in relation to disability discrimination. Ultimately, we aim to encourage further research into this topic. Hence, we establish some starting points and design a roadmap for ethicists, lawmakers, advocates as well as AI practitioners alike.},

abstract = {Due to increasing diversity and complexity of applications in embedded systems, accelerator designs trading-off area/energy-efficiency and design-productivity are becoming a further crucial issue. Targeting applications in the category of Recognition, Mining, and Synthesis (RMS), this study proposes a novel accelerator design to achieve a good trade-off in efficiency and design-productivity (or reusability) by introducing a new computing paradigm called “approximate computing” (AC). Leveraging from the facts that frequently executed parts of applications (i.e., hotspots) are conventionally the target of acceleration and that RMS applications are error-tolerant and often take similar input data repeatedly, our proposed accelerator reuses previous computational results of similar enough data to reduce computations. The proposed accelerator is composed of a simple controller and a dedicated memory to store limited sets of previous input data with corresponding computational results in a hotspot. Therefore, this accelerator can be applied to different and/or multiple hotspots/applications only through small extension of the controller, to achieve efficient accelerator design and resolve the design-productivity issue. We conducted quantitative evaluations using a representative RMS application (image compression) to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over conventional ones with precise computing. Moreover, we provide important findings on parameter exploration for our accelerator design, offering a wider applicability of our accelerator to other applications.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing has become a popular and indispensable component of many problem-solving pipelines in the research literature, with crowd workers often treated as computational resources that can reliably solve problems that computers have trouble with, such as image labeling/classification, natural language processing, or document writing. Yet, obviously crowd workers are human, and long sequences of the same monotonous tasks might intuitively reduce the amount of good quality work done by the workers. Here we propose an investigation into how we can use diversions containing small amounts of entertainment to improve crowd workers' experiences. We call these small period of entertainment ``micro-diversions", which we hypothesize to provide timely relief to workers during long sequences of micro-tasks. We hope to improve productivity by retaining workers to work on our tasks longer and to either improve or retain the quality of work. We experimentally test micro-diversions on Amazon's Mechanical Turk, a large paid-crowdsourcing platform. We find that micro-diversions can significantly improve worker retention rate while retaining the same work quality.},

Effort estimation permits managers and software engineers to anticipate, forecast, and precisely quote the schedule, budget and manpower requirements. By accurately estimating the effort; software projects can be saved from under run or over run. In this paper we have summarized and then analyzed the past work of software effort estimation in a systematic way. 10 researches were surveyed and explained briefly that how they are contributing towards solving the effort estimation problem in terms of time, cost or test. It also emphasizes that various effort estimation models have different pros and cons and can be used in different context on basis of different types of historical data. The survey discovered the most popular models used for effort prediction are supervised learning algorithms. The trends identified through this survey can help in exploring the potential research areas.},

abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications. For more experienced researchers and practitioners, the discussions in this book provide guidance for adopting a human-centered design and development approach to advance affective computing}

abstract = {People supported by AI-powered decision support tools frequently overrely on the AI: they accept an AI's suggestion even when that suggestion is wrong. Adding explanations to the AI decisions does not appear to reduce the overreliance and some studies suggest that it might even increase it. Informed by the dual-process theory of cognition, we posit that people rarely engage analytically with each individual AI recommendation and explanation, and instead develop general heuristics about whether and when to follow the AI suggestions. Building on prior research on medical decision-making, we designed three cognitive forcing interventions to compel people to engage more thoughtfully with the AI-generated explanations. We conducted an experiment (N=199), in which we compared our three cognitive forcing designs to two simple explainable AI approaches and to a no-AI baseline. The results demonstrate that cognitive forcing significantly reduced overreliance compared to the simple explainable AI approaches. However, there was a trade-off: people assigned the least favorable subjective ratings to the designs that reduced the overreliance the most. To audit our work for intervention-generated inequalities, we investigated whether our interventions benefited equally people with different levels of Need for Cognition (i.e., motivation to engage in effortful mental activities). Our results show that, on average, cognitive forcing interventions benefited participants higher in Need for Cognition more. Our research suggests that human cognitive motivation moderates the effectiveness of explainable AI solutions.},

The Wikipedia community has ensured the high-quality standards for an online encyclopaedia from the beginning and has built a sophisticated set of automated, semi-automated, and manual quality assurance mechanisms over the last fifteen years. The scientific community has systematically studied these mechanisms but one mechanism has been overlooked --- edit filters. Edit filters are syntactic rules that assess incoming edits, file uploads or account creations. As opposed to many other quality assurance mechanisms, edit filters are effective before a new revision is stored in the online encyclopaedia. In the exploratory study presented, we describe the role of edit filters in Wikipedia's quality assurance system. We examine how edit filters work, describe how the community governs their creation and maintenance, and look into the tasks these filters take over. Our goal is to steer researchers' attention to this quality control mechanism by pointing out directions for future studies.},

The problem of two cultures, research conducted in a vacuum (disconnected from the real world), or misaligned time horizons are just some of the many complex challenges standing in the way of successful industry–academia collaborations. This article reports on the experience of research collaboration and knowledge co-creation between industry and academia in software engineering as a way to bridge the research–practice collaboration gap. Our experience spans 14 years of collaboration between researchers in software engineering and the European and Norwegian software and IT industry. Using the participant observation and interview methods, we have collected and afterwards analyzed an extensive record of qualitative data. Drawing upon the findings made and the experience gained, we provide a set of 14 patterns and 14 anti-patterns for industry–academia collaborations, aimed to support other researchers and practitioners in establishing and running research collaboration projects in software engineering.},

Our tool enables organizations to measure, monitor, and control product quality through learning based defect prediction. Similar existing tools either provide data collection and analytics, or work just as a prediction engine. Therefore, companies need to deal with multiple tools with incompatible interfaces in order to deploy a complete measurement and prediction solution. Dione provides a fully integrated solution where data extraction, defect prediction and reporting steps fit seamlessly. In this paper, we present the major functionality and architectural elements of Dione followed by an overview of our demonstration.},

abstract = {An ongoing mystery of HCI is how do well-intentioned designers consistently enable products with unintentionally evil consequences. Using “questionable values” as a lens, we retell and analyze four design scenarios for smart homes that were created by participants with an IoT toolkit we designed. The selected design scenarios reveal practices that violate principles of responsible smart home design. Through our analysis we show (1) how participants explore sensor-driven objectification of the home then leverage data for surveillance, nudging, and control over others; (2) how the dominant technosolutionist narratives of efficiency and productivity ground such questionable values; (3) and how the materiality of mass-produced sensors pre-mediates questionable design scenarios. We discuss how to attend to and utilize questionable values in design: Making space for questionable values will empower design researchers to better “look around corners”, anticipating tomorrow's concerns and forestalling the worst of their harms.},

Likewise, scientists use Twitter to connect with other researchers, announce calls for papers, or share their thoughts. Filtering tweets, discovering other researchers, or finding relevant information on a topic of interest, however, is difficult since no directory of researchers on Twitter exists.In this paper we present an approach to identify Twitter accounts of researchers and demonstrate its utility for the discipline of computer science. Based on a seed set of computer science conferences we collect relevant Twitter users which we can partially map to ground-truth data. The mapping is leveraged to learn a model for classifying the remaining. To gain first insights into how researchers use Twitter, we empirically analyze the identified users and compare their age, popularity, influence, and social network.},

abstract = {Automatic knowledge graph construction aims to manufacture structured human knowledge. To this end, much effort has historically been spent extracting informative fact patterns from different data sources. However, more recently, research interest has shifted to acquiring conceptualized structured knowledge beyond informative data. In addition, researchers have also been exploring new ways of handling sophisticated construction tasks in diversified scenarios. Thus, there is a demand for a systematic review of paradigms to organize knowledge structures beyond data-level mentions. To meet this demand, we comprehensively survey more than 300 methods to summarize the latest developments in knowledge graph construction. A knowledge graph is built in three steps: knowledge acquisition, knowledge refinement, and knowledge evolution. The processes of knowledge acquisition are reviewed in detail, including obtaining entities with fine-grained types and their conceptual linkages to knowledge graphs; resolving coreferences; and extracting entity relationships in complex scenarios. The survey covers models for knowledge refinement, including knowledge graph completion, and knowledge fusion. Methods to handle knowledge evolution are also systematically presented, including condition knowledge acquisition, condition knowledge graph completion, and knowledge dynamic. We present the paradigms to compare the distinction among these methods along the axis of the data environment, motivation, and architecture. Additionally, we also provide briefs on accessible resources that can help readers to develop practical knowledge graph systems. The survey concludes with discussions on the challenges and possible directions for future exploration.},

abstract = {In an ideal world, a legal knowledge-based system would be evaluated by an evaluator with expertise in both the legal domain and software engineering evaluation processes. However in the real world, this task is typically undertaken by legal professionals, who may lack software engineering expertise. Where software engineers do have this responsibility, they may lack legal domain knowledge. We extend the ISO 14598 evaluation process with a novel evaluation framework which satisfies three important requirements: elements of existing software engineering evaluation methodologies are integrated and subsumed, making them more readily accessible to the evaluator; requirements specific to the legal domain are included; and the intended users do not necessarily require extensive software engineering expertise. The framework emphasises the importance of the evaluation context and goals and integrates these with system properties and contingency-guidelines to suggest appropriate evaluation criteria. The evaluation process supports the selection of criteria by manual, semi-automated or automated methods and a design of an architecture to support this choice of appropriate criteria, is presented. Two evaluations are discussed that were conducted using the process and its associated framework. With ongoing research and development in the field of Artificial intelligence and Law, the need for an easily accessible and specialized evaluation methodology is apparent. Such a method would assist legal professionals frame an evaluation of legal knowledge-based systems and help software engineers understand the evaluation requirements of legal professionals.},

abstract = {Nowadays, software developers often discuss the usage of various APIs in online forums. Automatically assigning pre-defined semantic categorizes to API discussions in these forums could help manage the data in online forums, and assist developers to search for useful information. We refer to this process as content categorization of API discussions. To solve this problem, Hou and Mo proposed the usage of naive Bayes multinomial, which is an effective classification algorithm. In this paper, we propose a Cache-bAsed compoSitE algorithm, short formed as CASE, to automatically categorize API discussions. Considering that the content of an API discussion contains both textual description and source code, CASE has 3 components that analyze an API discussion in 3 different ways: text, code, and original. In the text component, CASE only considers the textual description; in the code component, CASE only considers the source code; in the original component, CASE considers the original content of an API discussion which might include textual description and source code. Next, for each component, since different terms (i.e., words) have different affinities to different categories, CASE caches a subset of terms which have the highest affinity scores to each category, and builds a classifier based on the cached terms. Finally, CASE combines all the 3 classifiers to achieve a better accuracy score. We evaluate the performance of CASE on 3 datasets which contain a total of 1,035 API discussions. The experiment results show that CASE achieves accuracy scores of 0.69, 0.77, and 0.96 for the 3 datasets respectively, which outperforms the state-of-the-art method proposed by Hou and Mo by 11%, 10%, and 2%, respectively.},

abstract = {Code review consists of manual inspection, discussion, and judgment of source code by developers other than the code's author. Due to discussions around competing ideas and group decision-making processes, interpersonal conflicts during code reviews are expected. This study systematically investigates how developers perceive code review conflicts and addresses interpersonal conflicts during code reviews as a theoretical construct. Through the thematic analysis of interviews conducted with 22 developers, we confirm that conflicts during code reviews are commonplace, anticipated and seen as normal by developers. Even though conflicts do happen and carry a negative impact for the review, conflicts-if resolved constructively-can also create value and bring improvement. Moreover, the analysis provided insights on how strongly conflicts during code review and its context (i.e., code, developer, team, organization) are intertwined. Finally, there are aspects specific to code review conflicts that call for the research and application of customized conflict resolution and management techniques, some of which are discussed in this paper.

abstract = {As one of the most complex parts in manufacturing systems, scheduling plays an important role in the efficient allocation of resources to meet individual customization requirements. However, due to the uncertain disruptions (e.g., task arrival time, service breakdown duration) of manufacturing processes, how to respond to various dynamics in manufacturing to keep the scheduling process moving forward smoothly and efficiently is becoming a major challenge in dynamic manufacturing scheduling. To solve such a problem, a wide spectrum of artificial intelligence techniques have been developed to (1) accurately construct dynamic scheduling models that can represent both personalized customer needs and uncertain provider capabilities and (2) efficiently obtain a qualified schedule within a limited time. From these two perspectives, this article systemically makes a state-of-the-art literature survey on the application of these artificial intelligence techniques in dynamic manufacturing modeling and scheduling. It first introduces two types of dynamic scheduling problems that consider service- and task-related disruptions in the manufacturing process, respectively, followed by a bibliometric analysis of artificial intelligence techniques for dynamic manufacturing scheduling. Next, various kinds of artificial-intelligence-enabled schedulers for solving dynamic scheduling problems including both directed heuristics and autonomous learning methods are reviewed, which strive not only to quickly obtain optimized solutions but also to effectively achieve the adaption to dynamics. Finally, this article further elaborates on the future opportunities and challenges of using artificial-intelligence-enabled schedulers to solve complex dynamic scheduling problems. In summary, this survey aims to present a thorough and organized overview of artificial-intelligence-enabled dynamic manufacturing scheduling and shed light on some related research directions that are worth studying in the future.},

abstract = {As the amount of information online continues to grow, a correspondingly important opportunity is for individuals to reuse knowledge which has been summarized by others rather than starting from scratch. However, appropriate reuse requires judging the relevance, trustworthiness, and thoroughness of others' knowledge in relation to an individual's goals and context. In this work, we explore augmenting judgements of the appropriateness of reusing knowledge in the domain of programming, specifically of reusing artifacts that result from other developers' searching and decision making. Through an analysis of prior research on sensemaking and trust, along with new interviews with developers, we synthesized a framework for reuse judgements. The interviews also validated that developers express a desire for help with judging whether to reuse an existing decision. From this framework, we developed a set of techniques for capturing the initial decision maker's behavior and visualizing signals calculated based on the behavior, to facilitate subsequent consumers' reuse decisions, instantiated in a prototype system called Strata. Results of a user study suggest that the system significantly improves the accuracy, depth, and speed of reusing decisions. These results have implications for systems involving user-generated content in which other users need to evaluate the relevance and trustworthiness of that content.},

In this article, we present two controlled experiments involving 112 students to explore multiple computing activities (code comprehension, code review, and data structure manipulations) using three different objective measures including neuroimaging (functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)) and eye tracking. By examining code review and prose review using fMRI, we find that the neural representations of programming languages vs. natural languages are distinct. We can classify which task a participant is undertaking based solely on brain activity, and those task distinctions are modulated by expertise. We leverage insights from the psychological notion of spatial ability to decode the neural representations of several fundamental data structures and their manipulations using fMRI, fNIRS, and eye tracking. We examine list, array, tree, and mental rotation tasks and find that data structure and spatial operations use the same focal regions of the brain but to different degrees: they are related but distinct neural tasks. We demonstrate best practices and describe the implication and tradeoffs between fMRI, fNIRS, eye tracking, and self-reporting for software engineering research.},

abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) grows rapidly, huge amounts of wireless sensor networks emerged monitoring a wide range of infrastructure, in various domains such as healthcare, energy, transportation, smart city, building automation, agriculture, and industry producing continuously streamlines of data. Big Data technologies play a significant role within IoT processes, as visual analytics tools, generating valuable knowledge in real-time in order to support critical decision making. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of visualization methods, tools, and techniques for the IoT. We position data visualization inside the visual analytics process by reviewing the visual analytics pipeline. We provide a study of various chart types available for data visualization and analyze rules for employing each one of them, taking into account the special conditions of the particular use case. We further examine some of the most promising visualization tools. Since each IoT domain is isolated in terms of Big Data approaches, we investigate visualization issues in each domain. Additionally, we review visualization methods oriented to anomaly detection. Finally, we provide an overview of the major challenges in IoT visualizations.},

abstract = {Previous user experience research emphasizes meaning in interaction design beyond conventional interactive gestures. However, existing exemplars that successfully reify abstract meanings through interactions are usually case-specific, and it is currently unclear how to systematically create or extend meanings for general gesture-based interactions. We present Metaphoraction, a creativity support tool that formulates design ideas for gesture-based interactions to show metaphorical meanings with four interconnected components: gesture, action, object, and meaning. To represent the interaction design ideas with these four components, Metaphoraction links interactive gestures to actions based on the similarity of appearances, movements, and experiences; relates actions to objects by applying the immediate association; bridges objects and meanings by leveraging the metaphor TARGET-SOURCE mappings. We build a dataset containing 588,770 unique design idea candidates through surveying related research and conducting two crowdsourced studies to support meaningful gesture-based interaction design ideation. Five design experts validate that Metaphoraction can effectively support creativity and productivity during the ideation process. The paper concludes by presenting insights into meaningful gesture-based interaction design and discussing potential future uses of the tool.},

abstract = {Pressure for higher productivity and faster delivery is increasingly pervading software organizations. This can lead software engineers to act like chess players playing a gambit---making sacrifices of their technically sound estimates, thus submitting their teams to time pressure. In turn, time pressure can have varied detrimental effects, such as poor product quality and emotional distress, decreasing productivity, which leads to more time pressure and delays: a hard-to-stop vicious cycle. This reveals a need for moving on from the more passive strategy of yielding to pressure to a more active one of defending software estimates. Therefore, we propose an approach to support software estimators in acquiring knowledge on how to carry out such defense, by introducing negotiation principles encapsulated in a set of defense lenses, presented through a digital simulation. We evaluated the proposed approach through a controlled experiment with software practitioners from different companies. We collected data on participants' attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions to perform the defense of their estimates in light of the Theory of Planned Behavior. We employed a frequentist and a bayesian approach to data analysis. Results show improved scores among experimental group participants after engaging with the digital simulation and learning about the lenses. They were also more inclined to choose a defense action when facing pressure scenarios than a control group exposed to questions to reflect on the reasons and outcomes of pressure over estimates. Qualitative evidence reveals that practitioners perceived the set of lenses as useful in their current work environments. Collectively, these results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its perceived relevance for the industry, despite the low amount of time required to engage with it.},

abstract = {Achieving thermal comfort for occupants in buildings has been the main focus of several studies in recent years. The challenging issue of the building envelope is to save energy and achieve a high comfortable environment simultaneously. To calculate the thermal comfort level in a living space, environmental factors such as indoor air temperature, mean radiant temperature, air velocity, and humidity are needed. The latter parameters are aggregated through the well known PMV index. In this paper, we introduce a wireless sensor network (WSN)-based comfort measurement approach, called OnCom, using a dedicated ontology and the emotional state analysis of the occupant to reach the "adequate" indoor thermal comfort. The main thrust of OnCom stands on the smooth connection of human emotions with the thermal sensations. Carried out experiments showed that emotions, unveiled from tweets, have been efficiently used to mitigate user thermal discomfort.},

We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference.CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors.As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous "revise and resubmit" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels.Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on "Conversational AI &amp; Lessons Learned." Our closing plenary will feature Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, "The Science Gap." We also welcome Paul Luff and Christian Heath from King's College as the recipients of this year's CSCW Lasting Impact award for their influential 1998 paper, "Mobility in Collaboration."},

However, creating organizational hierarchies is difficult because the process requires a global understanding of the objects to be categorized. Usually one is created by an individual or a small group of people working together for hours or even days. Unfortunately, this centralized approach does not work well for the large, quickly changing datasets found on the web. Cascade is an automated workflow that allows crowd workers to spend as little at 20 seconds each while collectively making a taxonomy. We evaluate Cascade and show that on three datasets its quality is 80-90% of that of experts. Cascade has a competitive cost to expert information architects, despite taking six times more human labor. Fortunately, this labor can be parallelized such that Cascade will run in as fast as four minutes instead of hours or days.},

For those in already cognitively demanding work, many of us aim to optimise our effort and productivity to achieve more in work, and ideally to rest outside of work. Neuroergonomics research is concerned with how neurotechnology will help improve work to be manageable and safe, often in e.g. safety critical work, operators experience high demands and mental workload. Meanwhile, Neuroethics is concerned with the largely unregulated future of this industry, involving technologies that are not technically medical devices, but will involve invasive forms of personal data. This work aims to explicate the privacy, trust, and ethical concerns that workers have about employers using neurotechnology to manage their work-forces. An online survey and themes drawn from interviews with factory and office workers are presented. We conclude by discussing these concerns and how they might affect the rapidly expanding neurotechnology industry.},

abstract = {Recently, the importance of including obligations as part of access control systems for privilege management, for example, in healthcare information systems, has been well recognized. In an access control system, an a posteriori obligation states which actions need to be performed by a user after he has accessed a resource. There is no guarantee that a user will fulfill a posteriori obligations. Not fulfilling these obligations may incur financial loss, or loss of goodwill and productivity to the organization. In this paper, we propose a trust-and-obligation based framework that reduces the risk exposure of an organization associated with a posteriori obligations. We propose a methodology to assign trust values to users to indicate how trustworthy they are with regards to fulfilling their obligations. When access requests that trigger a posteriori obligations are evaluated, the requesting users' trust values and the criticality of the associated obligations are used. Our framework detects and mitigates insider attacks and unintentional damages that may result from violating a posteriori obligations. Our framework also provides mechanisms to determine misconfigurations of obligation policies. We evaluate our framework through simulations and demonstrate its effectiveness.},

abstract = {Code Review Automation can reduce human efforts during code review by automatically providing valuable information to reviewers. Nevertheless, it is a challenge to automate the process for large-scale companies, such as Samsung Electronics, due to their complexity: various development environments, frequent review requests, huge size of software, and diverse process among the teams. In this work, we show how we automated the code review process for those intricate environments, and share some lessons learned during two years of operation. Our unified code review automation system, Code Review Bot, is designed to process review requests holistically regardless of such environments, and checks various quality-assurance items such as potential defects in the code, coding style, test coverage, and open source license violations. Some key findings include: 1) about 60% of issues found by Code Review Bot were reviewed and fixed in advance of product releases, 2) more than 70% of developers gave positive feedback about the system, 3) developers rapidly and actively responded to reviews, and 4) the automation did not much affect the amount or the frequency of human code reviews compared to the internal policy to encourage code review activities. Our findings provide practical evidence that automating code review helps assure software quality.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art statistical machine translation (MT) systems have made significant progress towards producing user-acceptable translation output. However, there is still no efficient way for MT systems to inform users which words are likely translated correctly and how confident it is about the whole sentence. We propose a novel framework to predict word-level and sentence-level MT errors with a large number of novel features. Experimental results show that the MT error prediction accuracy is increased from 69.1 to 72.2 in F-score. The Pearson correlation between the proposed confidence measure and the human-targeted translation edit rate (HTER) is 0.6. Improvements between 0.4 and 0.9 TER reduction are obtained with the n-best list reranking task using the proposed confidence measure. Also, we present a visualization prototype of MT errors at the word and sentence levels with the objective to improve post-editor productivity.},

abstract = {In today's modern world, bugs in software systems incur significant costs. One promising approach to improve software quality is automated software verification. In this approach, an automated tool tries to prove the software correct once and for all. Although significant progress has been made in this direction, there are still many cases where automated tools fail. We focus specifically on one aspect of software verification that has been notoriously hard to automate: inferring loop invariants that are strong enough to enable verification. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem through gamification and crowdsourcing. In particular, we present a puzzle game where players find loop invariants without being aware of it, and without requiring any expertise on software verification. We show through an experiment with Mechanical Turk users that players enjoy the game, and are able to solve verification tasks that automated state-of-the-art tools cannot.},

abstract = {Subjective well-being (SWB) is a well-studied, widely used construct that refers to how people feel and think about their lives as one of many comprehensive perspectives on well-being. Much research has analyzed the role and utilization of technologies to improve one's SWB; however, especially when it comes to user modeling, multifaceted and variational aspects of SWB are less frequently considered. This paper presents an analysis on identifying factors for smartphone-based data on SWB and modeling SWB changes, based on a four-month user study with 78 college students. Our regression analysis highlights the significance of user attributes (e.g., personality, self-esteem) on SWB and salient factors derived from smartphone data (e.g., time spent on campus, ratio of standing/sitting stationary, expenses) that significantly account for SWB. Our classification analysis shows the potential for detecting SWB changes with reasonable performance, as well as for improving a model to be more tailored to individuals.},

abstract = {Programming can be an emotional experience, particularly for undergraduate students who are new to computer science. While researchers have interviewed novice programmers about their emotional experiences, it can be difficult to pinpoint the specific emotions that occur during a programming session. In this paper, we argue that electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors, which measure the physiological changes that are indicative of an emotional reaction, can provide a valuable new data source to help study student experiences. We conducted a study with 14 undergraduate students in which we collected EDA data while they worked on a programming problem. This data was then used to cue the participants’ recollections of their emotions during a retrospective interview about the programming experience. Using this methodology, we identified 21 distinct events that triggered student emotions, such as feeling anxiety due to a lack of perceived progress on the problem. We also identified common patterns in EDA data across multiple participants, such as a drop in their physiological reaction after developing a plan, corresponding with a calmer emotional state. These findings provide new information about how students experience programming that can inform research and practice, and also contribute initial evidence of the value of EDA data in supporting studies of emotions while programming.},

The toolset architecture is now being evolved to build and manage plugins for multiple Industrial Analytics solutions (software systems and services) beyond asset health. This evolution is driving changes in the desired architecture qualities of the toolset; widening the stakeholder pool and influencing priorities; affecting the architecture tradeoffs and decisions; and triggering updates to the product line architecture, the guidance for applying it, and the current prototype of the toolset. We describe our experiences in handling this evolution, assess lessons learned, and discuss potential relevance to other product line scenarios.},

The results of the empirical studies show the lack of convergence in choosing the best prediction technique between the parametric Regression Analysis and the non-parametric Estimation by Analogy models. In this paper, we introduce the use of a semi-parametric model that achieves to incorporate some parametric information into a non-parametric model combining in this way regression and analogy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the procedure of building such a model on two well-known datasets and we present the comparative results based on the predictive accuracy of the new technique using several accuracy measures. We also perform statistical tests on the residuals in order to assess the improvement in the predictions attained through the new semi-parametric model in comparison to the accuracy of Regression Analysis and Estimation by Analogy when applied separately. Our results show that the semi-parametric model provides more accurate predictions than each one of the parametric and non-parametric approaches.},

abstract = {The dynamic nature of AI technologies makes testing human-AI interaction and collaboration challenging – especially before such features are deployed in the wild. This presents a challenge for designers and AI practitioners as early feedback for iteration is often unavailable in the development phase. In this paper, we take inspiration from integration testing concepts in software development and present HINT (Human-AI INtegration Testing), a crowd-based framework for testing AI-based experiences integrated with a humans-in-the-loop workflow. HINT supports early testing of AI-based features within the context of realistic user tasks and makes use of successive sessions to simulate AI experiences that evolve over-time. Finally, it provides practitioners with reports to evaluate and compare aspects of these experiences. Through a crowd-based study, we demonstrate the need for over-time testing where user behaviors evolve as they interact with an AI system. We also show that HINT is able to capture and reveal these distinct user behavior patterns across a variety of common AI performance modalities using two AI-based feature prototypes. We further evaluated HINT’s potential to support practitioners’ evaluation of human-AI interaction experiences pre-deployment through semi-structured interviews with 13 practitioners.},

To improve the security awareness of users, recent automatic techniques produce security-centric descriptions by performing program analysis. However, the generated text does not always address users’ concerns as they are generally too technical to be understood by ordinary users. Moreover, different users have varied linguistic preferences that do not match the text. Motivated by this challenge, we develop an innovative scheme to help users avoid malware and privacy-breaching apps by generating security descriptions that explain the privacy and security related aspects of an Android app in clear and understandable terms. We implement a prototype system, PERSCRIPTION, to generate personalised security-centric descriptions that automatically learn users’ security concerns and linguistic preferences to produce user-oriented descriptions. We evaluate our scheme through experiments and user studies. The results clearly demonstrate the improvement on readability and users’ security awareness of PERSCRIPTION’s descriptions compared to existing description generators.},

We believe that user reviews in online stores can indicate heuristics issues, thus supporting evaluations more focused on the user feedback. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the presence of usability heuristic issues through user reviews. To achieve this goal, we collected and analyzed 200 reviews, split into 528 statements, from 10 free and paid Android and iOS apps. Our results showed that user reviews have certain potential to indicate heuristic issues, suggesting new and challenging future research for the CHI community.},

Domain analysis plays a critical role for systematic reuse, but domain analysis is difficult to perform, especially for new application areas. Analogical approach to reuse can support the domain analysis process by providing software products in a different but analogous domain. In order to achieve this goal, domain models need to be classified. This paper proposes a classification method for domain models. The method is an integration of the enumerative hierarchy and faceted scheme. The classification approach can help the domain analyst to locate an analogous domain to perform the modeling and analysis process. Moreover, the approach is more flexible and more descriptive than conventional classification methods.},

In this paper, we aim to decipher this collaboration complexity through a semi-structured interview study with 22 interviewees from teams of bio-medical scientists collaborating with data scientists. In the analysis, we adopt the Olsons' four-dimensions framework proposed in Distance Matters to code interview transcripts. Our findings suggest that besides the glitches in the collaboration readiness, technology readiness, and coupling of work dimensions, the tensions that exist in the common ground building process influence the collaboration outcomes, and then persist in the actual collaboration process. In contrast to prior works' general account of building a high level of common ground, the breakdowns of content common ground together with the strengthen of process common ground in this process is more beneficial for scientific discovery. We discuss why that is and what the design suggestions are, and conclude the paper with future directions and limitations.},

abstract = {Distributed ledger technology, frequently designated as 'blockchain,' is evolving from its hype phase toward greater maturity and long-term value creation. Although many academic communities were initially slow to grasp the technology's numerous potential implications, meanwhile a substantial amount of research is dedicated to investigating the development and impact of blockchain and related technologies. As undertaken, most research projects take a specific homogenous perspective, such as a technical or business viewpoint. To date, blockchain research studies are largely missing a bridge between and across academic disciplines. Given the manifold implications of blockchain technology, a fruitful crossdisciplinary exchange is therefore needed. In this paper, we bring together researchers with varying expertise to provide a vision into what may be next in terms of concepts, applications, and research agendas. We consider business, economic, societal, legal, technical, and philosophical viewpoints and propose multiple research questions as well as hypotheses arising from these diverse viewpoints. Simultaneously, we challenge various academic communities to tackle some of the most crucial issues of current blockchain research and to develop a solid foundation for future exploration.},

abstract = {To address the widespread problem of uncivil behavior, many online discussion platforms employ human moderators to take action against objectionable content, such as removing it or placing sanctions on its authors. Thisreactive paradigm of taking action against already-posted antisocial content is currently the most common form of moderation, and has accordingly underpinned many recent efforts at introducing automation into the moderation process. Comparatively less work has been done to understand other moderation paradigms---such as proactively discouraging the emergence of antisocial behavior rather than reacting to it---and the role algorithmic support can play in these paradigms. In this work, we investigate such a proactive framework for moderation in a case study of a collaborative setting: Wikipedia Talk Pages. We employ a mixed methods approach, combining qualitative and design components for a holistic analysis. Through interviews with moderators, we find that despite a lack of technical and social support, moderators already engage in a number of proactive moderation behaviors, such as preemptively intervening in conversations to keep them on track. Further, we explore how automation could assist with this existing proactive moderation workflow by building a prototype tool, presenting it to moderators, and examining how the assistance it provides might fit into their workflow. The resulting feedback uncovers both strengths and drawbacks of the prototype tool and suggests concrete steps towards further developing such assisting technology so it can most effectively support moderators in their existing proactive moderation workflow.},

abstract = {While a significant part of communication in the workplace is now happening online, current platforms don’t fully support socio-cognitive nonverbal communication, which hampers the shared understanding and creativity of virtual teams. Given text-based communication being the main channel for virtual collaboration, we propose a novel solution leveraging an AI-based, dynamic affective recognition system. The app provides live feedback about the affective content of the communication in Slack, in the form of a visual representation and percentage breakdown of the ‘sentiment’ (tone, emoji) and main ‘emotion states’ (e.g. joy, anger). We tested the usability of the app in a quasi-experiment with 30 participants from diverse backgrounds, linguistic analysis and user interviews. The findings show that the app significantly increases shared understanding and creativity within virtual teams. Emerged themes included impression formation assisted by affective recognition, supporting long-term relationships development; identified challenges related to transparency and emotional complexity detected by AI.},

abstract = {Reflecting on stress-related data is critical in addressing one’s mental health. Personal Informatics (PI) systems augmented by algorithms and sensors have become popular ways to help users collect and reflect on data about stress. While prediction algorithms in the PI systems are mainly for diagnostic purposes, few studies examine how the explainability of algorithmic prediction can support user-driven self-insight. To this end, we developed MindScope, an algorithm-assisted stress management system that determines user stress levels and explains how the stress level was computed based on the user’s everyday activities captured by a smartphone. In a 25-day field study conducted with 36 college students, the prediction and explanation supported self-reflection, a process to re-establish preconceptions about stress by identifying stress patterns and recalling past stress levels and patterns that led to coping planning. We discuss the implications of exploiting prediction algorithms that facilitate user-driven retrospection in PI systems.},

abstract = {Our personal smartphones are our daily companions, coming with us everywhere, including into enterprise meetings. This paper looks at smartphone use in meetings. Via a survey of 398 enterprise workers, we find that people believe phone use interferes with meeting productivity and collaboration. While individuals tend to think that they make productive use of their own phones in meetings, they perceive others as using their phones for unrelated tasks. To help smartphones create a more collaborative meeting environment, we present an application that identifies and describes meeting attendees. We deploy the application to 114 people at real meetings, and find that users value being able to access information about the other people in the room, particularly when those people are unfamiliar. To prevent users from disengaging from the meeting while using their phones, we employ a gaming approach that asks trivia questions about the other attendees. We observe that gameplay focuses attention within the meeting context and sparks conversations. These findings suggest ways smartphone applications might help users engage with the people around them in enterprise environments, rather than removing them from their immediate social context.},

Moreover, since dairy production is at the heart of food industry, it is critical to leverage innovative technologies to increase their efficiency and continuously meet the demanding standards from the farm level to market and reduce the amount of waste. Towards this end, we propose a Dairy 4.0 architecture capable of utilising information to detect and prevent flaws to the final dairy products. The architecture layers are based on machine vision and the digital twins technologies, while it respects the zero defect manufacturing (ZDM) approach. The proposed frameworks is structured on a four layer architecture: (i) the physical layer, which consists of dairy farming, dairy production, and dairy storage and logistics, (ii) the acquisition layer that is responsible for collecting contextual information, (iii) the digital twin layer which uses data from the vision system and the physical system to anticipate future occurrences, and finally (iv) the ZDM layer, which functions as an orchestrator and binding agent for all the processed data.},

Using the proposed model, the grievances are organized as High Priority, Medium Priority and Low Priority. It helps in the decision making process of the concerned government officials for redressing the Top Priority grievances within a specified time period, in contrast to Medium and Low Priority complaints. This enables the needy and common citizen to get appropriate public services delivery and government support which increases their confidence and faith on the administration and governmental services.},

Little is known about its association with the company as a whole, or the state where the company is based. This is due to the lack of scalable methodologies operationalizing depression in the specific context of the workplace, and of data documenting potential distress. In this work, we adapted a work-related depression scale called Occupational Depression Inventory (ODI), gathered more than 350K employee reviews of 104 major companies across the whole US for the (2008-2020) years, and developed a deep-learning framework (called AutoODI) scoring these reviews on a composite ODI score. Presence of ODI mentions manifested itself not only at micro-level (companies scoring high in ODI suffered from low stock growth) but also at macro-level (states hosting these companies were associated with high depression rates, talent shortage, and economic deprivation). This new way of applying AutoODI onto company reviews offers both theoretical implications for the literature in computational social science, occupational health and economic geography, and practical implications for companies and policy makers.},

abstract = {Paid micro-task crowdsourcing has gained in popularity partly due to the increasing need for large-scale manually labelled datasets which are often used to train and evaluate Artificial Intelligence systems. Modern paid crowdsourcing platforms use a piecework approach to rewards, meaning that workers are paid for each task they complete, given that their work quality is considered sufficient by the requester or the platform. Such an approach creates risks for workers; their work may be rejected without being rewarded, and they may be working on poorly rewarded tasks, in light of the disproportionate time required to complete them. As a result, recent research has shown that crowd workers may tend to choose specific, simple, and familiar tasks and avoid new requesters to manage these risks. In this paper, we propose a novel crowdsourcing reward mechanism that allows workers to share these risks and achieve a standardized hourly wage equal for all participating workers. Reward-focused workers can thereby take up challenging and complex HITs without bearing the financial risk of not being rewarded for completed work. We experimentally compare different crowd reward schemes and observe their impact on worker performance and satisfaction. Our results show that 1) workers clearly perceive the benefits of the proposed reward scheme, 2) work effectiveness and efficiency are not impacted as compared to those of the piecework scheme, and 3) the presence of slow workers is limited and does not disrupt the proposed cooperation-based approaches.},

How did Wikipedians do it? Besides the technical infrastructure, what social dynamics and processes are critical to its success? This essay reviews 217 articles that examined aspects of the behaviors of Wikipedia editors and the processes through which they coordinate and collaborate. Using the Input-Mediator-Output-Input model (IMOI) as the organizing framework, we summarized the key insights in an integrative review.

abstract = {Team members commonly collaborate on visual documents remotely and asynchronously. Particularly, students are frequently restricted to this setting as they often do not share work schedules or physical workspaces. As communication in this setting has delays and limits the main modality to text, members exert more effort to reference document objects and understand others’ intentions. We propose Winder, a Figma plugin that addresses these challenges through linked tapes—multimodal comments of clicks and voice. Bidirectional links between the clicked-on objects and voice recordings facilitate understanding tapes: selecting objects retrieves relevant recordings, and playing recordings highlights related objects. By periodically prompting users to produce tapes, Winder preemptively obtains information to satisfy potential communication needs. Through a five-day study with eight teams of three, we evaluated the system’s impact on teams asynchronously designing graphical user interfaces. Our findings revealed that producing linked tapes could be as lightweight as face-to-face (F2F) interactions while transmitting intentions more precisely than text. Furthermore, with preempted tapes, teammates coordinated tasks and invited members to build on each others’ work.},

abstract = {Assessing the personality of software engineers may help to match individual traits with the characteristics of development activities such as code review and testing, as well as support managers in team composition. However, self-assessment questionnaires are not a practical solution for collecting multiple observations on a large scale. Instead, automatic personality detection, while overcoming these limitations, is based on off-the-shelf solutions trained on non-technical corpora, which might not be readily applicable to technical domains like software engineering. In this article, we first assess the performance of general-purpose personality detection tools when applied to a technical corpus of developers’ e-mails retrieved from the public archives of the Apache Software Foundation. We observe a general low accuracy of predictions and an overall disagreement among the tools. Second, we replicate two previous research studies in software engineering by replacing the personality detection tool used to infer developers’ personalities from pull-request discussions and e-mails. We observe that the original results are not confirmed, i.e., changing the tool used in the original study leads to diverging conclusions. Our results suggest a need for personality detection tools specially targeted for the software engineering domain.},

Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs), whether virtually or physically embodied, are autonomous agents that are able to perceive an environment including people or other agents, reason, decide how to interact, and express attitudes such as emotions, engagement, or empathy. They are capable of interacting with people and one another in a socially intelligent manner using multimodal communicative behaviors, with the goal to support humans in various domains.Written by international experts in their respective fields, the book summarizes research in the many important research communities pertinent for SIAs, while discussing current challenges and future directions. The handbook provides easy access to modeling and studying SIAs for researchers and students, and aims at further bridging the gap between the research communities involved.In two volumes, the book clearly structures the vast body of research. The first volume starts by introducing what is involved in SIAs research, in particular research methodologies and ethical implications of developing SIAs. It further examines research on appearance and behavior, focusing on multimodality. Finally, social cognition for SIAs is investigated using different theoretical models and phenomena such as theory of mind or pro-sociality. The second volume starts with perspectives on interaction, examined from different angles such as interaction in social space, group interaction, or long-term interaction. It also includes an extensive overview summarizing research and systems of human–agent platforms and of some of the major application areas of SIAs such as education, aging support, autism, and games.}

abstract = {In South Korea, Manufacturing Innovation 3.0 Strategy is now underway by the government since 2014. The core of this strategy is to change the existing 20,000 factories to smart factories by 2022. For this, the Korea Government established Korea Smart Factory Foundation and has being investing a large finance for the purpose of the smart factory's proliferation. As a result of this, the government expects that there will build the foundation to enable the advanced smart factory based on Internet of Things, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence. Despite these efforts, the companies are still hesitant the construction of the smart factory because of the additional expenses caused by the construction of ICT infrastructure and the employment of ICT human resources. On the other hand, they knows the merits of the smart factory and wants some services supported by that, such as the quality test, the aggregation of the actual production, the manufacturing facility maintenance, etc. That is, the underfinanced companies requires the smart factory optimized for their works. The important point to notice is that the implementation of the smart factory can be different according to the factory environments, a type of the manufacturing facility, and data to be collected, even if the companies want same service. Moreover, because every company has its own requirements, it is necessary to design factory-optimized smart factory. Therefore, a smart factory designer must consider and analyse the requirements of company and characteristics of the factory. In this paper, we first describe the four considerations for the establishment of the smart factory in the small and medium enterprises and introduce three case studies in conjunction with the small and medium-sized enterprises that require the smart factory optimized for their business or factory rather than the high-level smart factory.},

abstract = {Background: The unprecedented access to data has rendered a remarkable opportunity to analyze, understand, and optimize the investigation approaches in almost all the areas of (Empirical) Software Engineering. However, data analytics is time and effort consuming, thus, expensive, and not automatically valuable.Objective: This vision paper demonstrates that it is crucial to consider Return-on-Investment (ROI) when performing Data Analytics. Decisions on "How much analytics is needed"? are hard to answer. ROI could guide for decision support on the What?, How?, and How Much? analytics for a given problem.Method: The proposed conceptual framework is validated through two empirical studies that focus on requirements dependencies extraction in the Mozilla Firefox project. The two case studies are (i) Evaluation of fine-tuned BERT against Naive Bayes and Random Forest machine learners for binary dependency classification and (ii) Active Learning against passive Learning (random sampling) for REQUIRES dependency extraction. For both the cases, their analysis investment (cost) is estimated, and the achievable benefit from DA is predicted, to determine a break-even point of the investigation.Results: For the first study, fine-tuned BERT performed superior to the Random Forest, provided that more than 40% of training data is available. For the second, Active Learning achieved higher F1 accuracy within fewer iterations and higher ROI compared to Baseline (Random sampling based RF classifier). In both the studies, estimate on, How much analysis likely would pay off for the invested efforts?, was indicated by the break-even point.Conclusions: Decisions for the depth and breadth of DA of empirical data should not be made solely based on the accuracy measures. Since ROI-driven Data Analytics provides a simple yet effective direction to discover when to stop further investigation while considering the cost and value of the various types of analysis, it helps to avoid over-analyzing empirical data.},

abstract = {Details of the designs and mechanisms in support of human-AI collaboration must be considered in the real-world fielding of AI technologies. A critical aspect of interaction design for AI-assisted human decision making are policies about the display and sequencing of AI inferences within larger decision-making workflows. We have a poor understanding of the influences of making AI inferences available before versus after human review of a diagnostic task at hand. We explore the effects of providing AI assistance at the start of a diagnostic session in radiology versus after the radiologist has made a provisional decision. We conducted a user study where 19 veterinary radiologists identified radiographic findings present in patients’ X-ray images, with the aid of an AI tool. We employed two workflow configurations to analyze (i) anchoring effects, (ii) human-AI team diagnostic performance and agreement, (iii) time spent and confidence in decision making, and (iv) perceived usefulness of the AI. We found that participants who are asked to register provisional responses in advance of reviewing AI inferences are less likely to agree with the AI regardless of whether the advice is accurate and, in instances of disagreement with the AI, are less likely to seek the second opinion of a colleague. These participants also reported that the AI advice to be less useful. Surprisingly, requiring provisional decisions on cases in advance of the display of AI inferences did not lengthen the time participants spent on the task. The study provides generalizable and actionable insights for the deployment of clinical AI tools in human-in-the-loop systems and introduces a methodology for studying alternative designs for human-AI collaboration. We make our experimental platform available as open source to facilitate future research on the influence of alternate designs on human-AI workflows.},

abstract = {Built on top of human resources management databases within the enterprise, we present a decision support system for managing and optimizing screening activities during the hiring process in a large organization. The basic idea is to prioritize the efforts of human resource practitioners to focus on candidates that are likely of high quality, that are likely to accept a job offer if made one, and that are likely to remain with the organization for the long term. To do so, the system first individually ranks candidates along several dimensions using a keyword matching algorithm and several bipartite ranking algorithms with univariate loss trained on historical actions. Next, individual rankings are aggregated to derive a single list that is presented to the recruitment team through an interactive portal. The portal supports multiple filters that facilitate effective identification of candidates. We demonstrate the usefulness of our system on data collected from a large organization over several years with business value metrics showing greater hiring yield with less interviews. Similarly, using historical pre-hire data we demonstrate accurate identification of candidates that will have quickly left the organization. The system has been deployed as described in a large globally integrated enterprise.},

abstract = {Software comments sometimes are not promptly updated in sync when the associated code is changed. The inconsistency between code and comments may mislead the developers and result in future bugs. Thus, studies concerning code-comment synchronization have become highly important, which aims to automatically synchronize comments with code changes. Existing code-comment synchronization approaches mainly contain two types, i.e., (1) deep learning-based (e.g., CUP), and (2) heuristic-based (e.g., HebCUP). The former constructs a neural machine translation-structured semantic model, which has a more generalized capability on synchronizing comments with software evolution and growth. However, the latter designs a series of rules for performing token-level replacements on old comments, which can generate the completely correct comments for the samples fully covered by their fine-designed heuristic rules. In this article, we propose a composite approach named CBS (i.e., Classifying Before Synchronizing) to further improve the code-comment synchronization performance, which combines the advantages of CUP and HebCUP with the assistance of inferred categories of Code-Comment Inconsistent (CCI) samples. Specifically, we firstly define two categories (i.e., heuristic-prone and non-heuristic-prone) for CCI samples and propose five features to assist category prediction. The samples whose comments can be correctly synchronized by HebCUP are heuristic-prone, while others are non-heuristic-prone. Then, CBS employs our proposed Multi-Subsets Ensemble Learning (MSEL) classification algorithm to alleviate the class imbalance problem and construct the category prediction model. Next, CBS uses the trained MSEL to predict the category of the new sample. If the predicted category is heuristic-prone, CBS employs HebCUP to conduct the code-comment synchronization for the sample, otherwise, CBS allocates CUP to handle it. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CBS statistically significantly outperforms CUP and HebCUP, and obtains an average improvement of 23.47%, 22.84%, 3.04%, 3.04%, 1.64%, and 19.39% in terms of Accuracy, Recall@5, Average Edit Distance (AED), Relative Edit Distance (RED), BLEU-4, and Effective Synchronized Sample (ESS) ratio, respectively, which highlights that category prediction for CCI samples can boost the code-comment synchronization performance.},

abstract = {Despite debates about emotion artificial intelligence's (EAI) validity, legality, and social consequences, EAI is increasingly present in the high stakes context of hiring, with potential to shape the future of work and the workforce. The values laden in technology play a significant role in its societal impact.We conducted qualitative content analysis on the public-facing websites (N=229) of EAI hiring services. We identify the organizational problems that EAI hiring services claim to solve and reveal the values emerging in desired EAI uses as promoted by EAI hiring services to solve organizational problems. Our findings show that EAI hiring services market their technologies as technosolutions to three purported organizational hiring problems: 1) hiring (in)accuracy, 2) hiring (mis)fit, and 3) hiring (in)authenticity. We unpack these problems to expose how these desired uses of EAI are legitimized by the corporate ideals of data-driven decision making, continuous improvement, precision, loyalty, and stability. We identify the unfair and deceptive mechanisms by which EAI hiring services claim to solve the purported organizational hiring problems, suggesting that they unfairly exclude and exploit job candidates through EAI's creation, extraction, and affective commodification of a candidate's affective value through pseudoscientific approaches. Lastly, we interrogate EAI hiring service claims to reveal the core values that underpin their stated desired use: techno-omnipresence, techno-omnipotence, and techno-omniscience. We show how EAI hiring services position desired use of their technology as a moral imperative for hiring organizations with supreme capabilities to solve organizational hiring problems, then discuss implications for fairness, ethics, and policy in EAI-enabled hiring within the US policy landscape.},

abstract = {Code review is a critical step in modern software quality assurance, yet it is vulnerable to human biases. Previous studies have clarified the extent of the problem, particularly regarding biases against the authors of code,but no consensus understanding has emerged. Advances in medical imaging are increasingly applied to software engineering, supporting grounded neurobiological explorations of computing activities, including the review, reading, and writing of source code. In this paper, we present the results of a controlled experiment using both medical imaging and also eye tracking to investigate the neurological correlates of biases and differences between genders of humans and machines (e.g., automated program repair tools) in code review. We find that men and women conduct code reviews differently, in ways that are measurable and supported by behavioral, eye-tracking and medical imaging data. We also find biases in how humans review code as a function of its apparent author, when controlling for code quality. In addition to advancing our fundamental understanding of how cognitive biases relate to the code review process, the results may inform subsequent training and tool design to reduce bias.},

abstract = {Autonomous systems will soon be integrating into our lives as home assistants, delivery drones, and driverless cars. The implementation of the level of automation in these systems from being manually controlled to fully autonomous would depend upon the autonomy approach chosen to design these systems. This article reviews the historical evolution of autonomy, its approaches, and the current trends in related fields to build robust autonomous systems. Toward such a goal and with the increased number of cyberattacks, the security of these systems needs special attention from the research community. To gauge the extent to which research has been done in this area, we discuss the cybersecurity of these systems. It is essential to model the system from a security perspective, identify the threats and vulnerabilities, and then model the attacks. A survey in this direction explores the theoretical/analytical system and attack models that have been proposed over the years and identifies the research gap that needs to be addressed by the research community.},

This research was conducted using quantitative methods on 70 samples of auditor respondents who work in Public Accounting Firms in Indonesia. The analytical method used in this study is PLS-SEM with behavioral intention as the dependent variable. This study found that the variables of independent performance expectations, business expectations, social influences, and facilitation conditions had no significant effect on behavioral intentions. While the trust variable has a significant positive effect. The abstract needs to summarize the content of the paper.},

abstract = {Visualization grammars, often based on the Grammar of Graphics (GoG), have much potential for augmenting data analysis in a programming environment. However, we do not know how analysts conceptualize grammar abstractions, or how a visualization grammar works with data analysis in practice. Therefore, we qualitatively analyzed how experienced analysts (N = 6) from TidyTuesday, a social data project, wrangled and visualized data using GoG-based ggplot2 without given tasks in R Markdown. Though participants’ analysis and customization needs could mismatch with GoG component design, their analysis processes aligned with the goal of GoG to expedite visualization iteration. We also found a feedback loop and tight coupling between visualization and data transformation code, explaining both participants’ productivity and their errors. From these results, we discuss how future visualization grammars can become more practical for analysts and how visualization grammar and analysis tools can better integrate within a programming (i.e., computational notebook) environment.},

We interviewed 15 recruiters and HR professionals about their experiences around two decision-making processes during hiring: sourcing and assessment. For both, AI-enabled software allowed the efficient processing of candidate data, thus providing the ability to introduce or advance candidates from broader and more diverse pools. For sourcing, it can serve as a useful learning resource to find candidates. Though, a lack of trust in data accuracy and an inadequate level of control over algorithmic candidate matches can create reluctance to embrace it. For assessment, its implementation varied across companies depending on the industry and the hiring scenario. Its inclusion may redefine HR professionals' job content as it automates or augments pieces of the existing hiring process. Finally, we discuss how candidate roles that recruiters and HR professionals support drive the use of algorithmic hiring software.},

abstract = {While the global population continues to grow, more people are living in cities. In 2018, 55 per cent of the world's population lived in cities. By 2050, this is expected to increase to 68 per cent - almost seven in every ten people will live in cities. If sustainable development is to deliver to all people, urban development plays a critical role. The 'smart city' is now the playbook for resilient, sustainable and liveable cities, and smart technologies are creating daily touchpoints that make both huge and small impacts across all walks of people's lives. Today's cities and tomorrow's smart cities are intricately linked to the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development across its 17 goals. This paper first explores at-a-glance the fundamentals and layers that support smart cities, providing an overview but not a deep-dive into the technicalities. This includes, but not limited to, the policy and infrastructure frameworks, the data ecosystem including open data and big, data, the device level including Internet of Things and mobile devices, and the application level in general. Three dimensions of policy integration in smart city development is suggested, namely: (i) horizontal integration across sectors and disciplines; (ii) vertical integration across different governmental levels as well as linkages between national and local development; and (iii) a whole-of-society approach in smart city development with the engagement of the private sector and civil society. The nexus of smart city goals and the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is then articulated. Building on the key issues identified, a high-level analysis of global and regional metrics in accessing smart cities is done, emphasizing the importance of the clich\'{e} - "what's get measured, gets valued".},

abstract = {Across the years, production systems have recurrently turned to new digital technologies in the search for enhanced productivity and competitiveness. More recently, a prelude to a Fourth Industrial Revolution has been heard, announcing Industry 4.0 as the future of production and manufacture. It has been claimed that cyber-physical production systems would bring drastic changes in the way that people go about engaging in work. It is therefore sensible to think that the way that cooperation is accomplished within production contexts will be also affected. Based on an in-depth interview study featuring 21 participants from different companies, we go on to discuss which challenges have been emerging from recent digitalisation of production work in regard to the way that workers cooperate in accomplishing their productive activities. Our results suggest that there are associated group effects - e.g., group polarisation, hidden profiles, and exclusion - that pose relevant challenges for cooperation within these settings. In this contribution, we go on to present and discuss these results and to propose articulation spaces, which conceptually bring together aspects of coordination mechanisms and common information spaces, as a potential solution for some of those challenges.},

However, detailed quantitative evaluations of such recommender systems are lacking. In this paper we present an automated evaluation process which extracts queries and expected results from existing code bases. This enables the validation of recommendation systems with large test beds in an objective manner by means of precision and recall measures. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by evaluating an improvement of an existing API recommender tool that takes into account the framework-method context for recommendations.},

abstract = {We propose a design methodology to facilitate rigorous development of complex applications targeting reconfigurable hardware. Our methodology relies on analytical estimation of system performance and area utilisation for a given specific application and a particular system instance consisting of a controlflow machine working in conjunction with one or more reconfigurable dataflow accelerators. The targeted application is carefully analyzed, and the parts identified for hardware acceleration are reimplemented as a set of representative software models. Next, with the results of the application analysis, a suitable system architecture is devised and its performance is evaluated to determine bottlenecks, allowing predictable design. The architecture is iteratively refined, until the final version satisfying the specification requirements in terms of performance and required hardware area is obtained. We validate the presented methodology using a widely accepted convolutional neural network (VGG-16) and an important HPC application (BQCD). In both cases, our methodology relieved and alleviated all system bottlenecks before the hardware implementation was started. As a result the architectures were implemented first time right, achieving state-of-the-art performance within 15% of our modelling estimations.},

abstract = {Recent wearable devices enable continuous and unobtrusive monitoring of human's physiological parameters, like e.g., electrodermal activity and heart rate, over long periods of time in everyday life settings. Continuous monitoring of these parameters enables the creation of systems able to predict affective states and stress with the goal of providing feedback to improve them. Deployment of such systems in everyday life settings is still complex and prone to errors due to the low quality of the collected data impacted by the presence of artifacts. In this paper we present an automatic approach to detect artifacts in electrodermal activity (EDA) signals collected in-the-wild over long periods of time. To this end we first perform a systematic literature review and compile a set of guidelines for human annotators to label artifacts manually and we use these labels as ground-truth to test our automatic approach. To evaluate our approach, we collect physiological data from 13 participants in-the-wild and two human annotators label 107.56 hours of this data set. We make the data set publicly available to other researchers upon request. Our model achieves a recall of 98% for clean and shape artifacts classification on data collected in-the-wild using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, which is 42 percentage points higher than the baseline. We show that state of the art approaches do not generalize well when tested with completely in-the-wild data and identify only 17% of the artifacts present in our data set, even after manual adaption. We further test the robustness of our approach over time using leave-one-day-out and achieve very similar performance. We then introduce a new metric to evaluate the quality of EDA segments that considers the impact of not only artifacts in the shape of EDA but also artifacts generated by environmental temperature changes or user's high intensity movement. Our results imply that we can eliminate the need for human annotators or significantly reduce the time they need to label data. Also, our approach can be used in an online manner to automatically detect artifacts in EDA signals.},

abstract = {The Handbook on Socially Interactive Agents provides a comprehensive overview of the research fields of Embodied Conversational Agents, Intelligent Virtual Agents, and Social Robotics. Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs), whether virtually or physically embodied, are autonomous agents that are able to perceive an environment including people or other agents, reason, and decide how to interact, and express attitudes such as emotions, engagement, or empathy. They are capable of interacting with people and each other in a socially intelligent manner using multimodal communicative behaviors with the goal to support humans in various domains.Written by international experts in their respective fields, the book summarizes research in the many important research communities pertinent for SIAs, while discussing current challenges and future directions. The handbook provides easy access to modeling and studying SIAs for researchers and students and aims at further bridging the gap between the research communities involved.In two volumes, the book clearly structures the vast body of research. The first volume starts by introducing what is involved in SIAs research, in particular research methodologies and ethical implications of developing SIAs. It further examines research on appearance and behavior, focusing on multimodality. Finally, social cognition for SIAs is investigated by different theoretical models and phenomena such as theory of mind or pro-sociality. The second volume starts with perspectives on interaction, examined from different angles such as interaction in social space, group interaction, or long-term interaction. It also includes an extensive overview summarizing research and systems of human-agent platforms and of some of the major application areas of SIAs such as education, aging support, autism or games.}

abstract = {Java is one of the most widely used programming languages. However, Java is a verbose language, thus one of the main drawbacks of the language is that even simple tasks often entail writing a significant amount of code. In some cases, writing too much code might lead to certain code smells, which are violations of fundamental design that can negatively impact the overall quality of programs. To allow programmers to write concise code, JetBrains created a new language named Kotlin. Nevertheless, few studies have evaluated whether Kotlin leads to concise and clearer code in comparison to Java. We conjecture that due to Java's verbosity, programs written in Java are likely to have more code smells than Kotlin programs. Therefore, we set out to evaluate whether some types of code smells are more common in Java programs. To this end, we carried out a large-scale empirical study involving more than 6 million lines of code from programs available in 100 repositories. We found that on average Kotlin programs have less code smells than Java programs.},

abstract = {Modern application stores enable developers to classify their apps by choosing from a set of generic categories, or genres, such as health, games, and music. These categories are typically static—new categories do not necessarily emerge over time to reflect innovations in the mobile software landscape. With thousands of apps classified under each category, locating apps that match a specific consumer interest can be a challenging task. To overcome this challenge, in this article, we propose an automated approach for classifying mobile apps into more focused categories of functionally related application domains. Our aim is to enhance apps visibility and discoverability. Specifically, we employ word embeddings to generate numeric semantic representations of app descriptions. These representations are then classified to generate more cohesive categories of apps. Our empirical investigation is conducted using a dataset of 600 apps, sampled from the Education, Health&amp;Fitness, and Medical categories of the Apple App Store. The results show that our classification algorithms achieve their best performance when app descriptions are vectorized using GloVe, a count-based model of word embeddings. Our findings are further validated using a dataset of Sharing Economy apps and the results are evaluated by 12 human subjects. The results show that GloVe combined with Support Vector Machines can produce app classifications that are aligned to a large extent with human-generated classifications.},

While secondary studies on MCR exist, it is uanknown whether the research community has targeted themes that practitioners consider important.Objectives: The objectives are to provide an overview of MCR research, analyze the practitioners’ opinions on the importance of MCR research, investigate the alignment between research and practice, and propose future MCR research avenues.Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study to survey state of the art until and including 2021, employed the Q-Methodology to analyze the practitioners’ perception of the relevance of MCR research, and analyzed the primary studies’ research impact.Results: We analyzed 244 primary studies, resulting in five themes. As a result of the 1,300 survey data points, we found that the respondents are positive about research investigating the impact of MCR on product quality and MCR process properties. In contrast, they are negative about human factor– and support systems–related research.Conclusion: These results indicate a misalignment between the state of the art and the themes deemed important by most survey respondents. Researchers should focus on solutions that can improve the state of MCR practice. We provide an MCR research agenda that can potentially increase the impact of MCR research.},

We propose two studies, which seek different angles at the fundamental questions we pose. Further, we propose it as a fruitful case study for thinking about what authentication can, and should, be expected to do, as it pushes up against questions of what sorts of "selves" authentication systems must be tasked with recognizing. Through this discussion, we raise novel possibilities for authentication broadly, such as "organic passwords" that change naturally over time, or systems that reject users who are not acting quite "like themselves."},

Given these forces, we are at a time of opportunity for research impact, with an unusually large potential for influential results across computing, the sciences and society. This report details that discussion, and highlights the group's consensus view of new focus areas, including new database engine architectures, declarative programming languages, the interplay of structured and unstructured data, cloud data services, and mobile and virtual worlds.

Such factors include confirmation bias, perceived credibility of the information source, individual media literacy, social norms, and others. This paper reviews the interventions designed to address misinformation and examines how various underlying mechanisms of response to misinformation are operationalized and implemented in the reviewed interventions. Key findings show that most prior work to address misinformation heavily focuses on individual pieces of misinformation and the actions individuals take in response to those individual pieces. These individualistic approaches, we argue, overlook the other drivers of responses to misinformation, such as individuals' prior beliefs and the social contexts in which misinformation is encountered. Additionally, the analysis shows that an individualistic focus on misinformation draws attention away from the systemic nature and consequences of misinformation. This paper argues that to overcome the limitation of individualistic approaches to addressing misinformation, future interventions need to expand their scope beyond individualistic approaches. As one way to do so, it discusses leveraging the impacts of community factors that impact the spread and impacts of misinformation. The paper concludes by using social norms as an example to illustrate how a focus on community factors might work in practice.},

We specifically concentrate on mining model patterns from a dataset of real mashup models taken from Yahoo! Pipes and cover the entire pattern mining process, including pattern identification and quality assessment. The results of our experiments show that a sensible design of crowdsourcing tasks indeed may enable the crowd to identify patterns from small datasets (40 models). The results, however, also show that the design of tasks for the assessment of the quality of patterns to decide which patterns to retain for further processing and use is much harder (our experiments fail to elicit assessments from the crowd that are similar to those by an expert). The problem is relevant in general to model-driven development (e.g., UML, business processes, scientific workflows), in that reusable model patterns encode valuable modeling and domain knowledge, such as best practices, organizational conventions, or technical choices, that modelers can benefit from when designing their own models.},

abstract = {Through a design-led inquiry focused on smart home security cameras, this research develops three key concepts for research and design pertaining to new and emerging digital consumer technologies. Digital leakage names the propensity for digital information to be shared, stolen, and misused in ways unbeknownst or even harmful to those to whom the data pertains or belongs. Hole-and-corner applications are those functions connected to users' data, devices, and interactions yet concealed from or downplayed to them, often because they are non-beneficial or harmful to them. Foot-in-the-door devices are product and services with functional offerings and affordances that work to normalize and integrate a technology, thus laying groundwork for future adoption of features that might have earlier been rejected as unacceptable or unnecessary. Developed and illustrated through a set of design studies and explorations, this paper shows how these concepts may be used analytically to investigate issues such as privacy and security, anticipatorily to speculate about the future of technology development and use, and generatively to synthesize design concepts and solutions.},

abstract = {Using data and data technologies to support healthcare has drawn significant attention recently. While CSCW and HCI have largely celebrated the tremendous promise of 'data-driven healthcare' in reforming the healthcare sector, this paper reveals 'labor-driven reality' of this promised data-driven future. Drawing from a qualitative study in a real-world data-driven long-term care (LTC) facility in China, we demonstrate how data-driven technologies work in practice, and especially how frontline workers, as the crux of this data-driven configuration, conduct a tremendous amount of "data work" to make data-drivenness work. This data work, we argue, goes beyond the "clerical work" and functions as a labor of maintenance, articulation, and repair, that both guarantees data technologies' functionalities and acts as an interface between stakeholders. We conclude by discussing the practices, problems and opportunities of this data work in a boarder socio-cultural context.},

abstract = {This article aims to overcome the empirical limitations of tourism studies concerning customer experience, to focus on the transformations of work activity. From an ergonomics perspective focusing on work activity in two hotels, the article proposes an analysis about smart technologies based on a case study of a chatbot or conversational agent (CA) and proposes an alternative to implement technology in work design. This study uses a systemic approach and incorporates semi-structured interviews, UX curves with different stakeholders (N=7) from touristic organisation: strategic, operational and design workers. Results show that the different stakeholders do not share the same representation of chatbots. Designers and strategy workers consider the technology as a way to improve the customer experience and reduce work constraints by eliminating tasks and creating a new tasks redistribution. Furthermore, the use of chatbot reveals greater flexibility for the operational staff. We also note reconfigurations of work for both staff and designers in order to allow chatbot evolutivity and efficiency over timeIn the light of these statements, this research shows that the deployment of technology cannot be successful without a comprehensive analysis of the work activity context. This study also highlights the role of human intelligence in the creation of evolving and contextually adapted tourism systems. From a general point of view, the introduction of technologies has led to a profound reorganisation of the stage and backstage tasks. They can also be deleterious to work and service relationship when the conditions of their implementation are not thought out in advance. The article suggests to design these work systems through a human-centred approach by contributing to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology at the service of humans and their work.},

However, developers often only use a small subset of the commands offered by modern development environments, reducing their overall development fluency. In this paper, we use several existing command recommender algorithms to suggest new commands to developers based on their existing command usage history, and also introduce several new algorithms. By running these algorithms on data submitted by several thousand Eclipse users, we describe two studies that explore the feasibility of automatically recommending commands to software developers. The results suggest that, while recommendation is more difficult in development environments than in other domains, it is still feasible to automatically recommend commands to developers based on their usage history, and that using patterns of past discovery is a useful way to do so.},

abstract = {Background: Size features such as lines of code and function points are deemed essential for effort estimation. No one questions under what conditions size features are actually a "must".Aim: To question the need for size features and to propose a method that compensates their absence.Method: A baseline analogy-based estimation method (1NN) and a state-of-the-art learner (CART) are run on reduced (with no size features) and full (with all features) versions of 13 SEE data sets. 1NN is augmented with a popularity-based pre-processor to create "pop1NN". The performance of pop1NN is compared to 1NN and CART using 10-way cross validation w.r.t. MMRE, MdMRE, MAR, PRED(25), MBRE, MIBRE, and MMER.Results: Without any pre-processor, removal of size features decreases the performance of 1NN and CART. For 11 out of 13 data sets, pop1NN removes the necessity of size features. pop1NN (using reduced data) has a comparable performance to CART (using full data).Conclusion: Size features are important and their use is endorsed. However, if there are insufficient means to collect software size metrics, then the use of methods like pop1NN may compensate for size metrics with only a small loss in estimation accuracy.},

Language models have recently been able to generate text fluently, producing new stochastic narratives upon request. However, effectively integrating such capabilities with human cognitive faculties and creative processes remains challenging. We propose to investigate this integration with a multimodal writing support interface that offers writing suggestions textually, visually, and aurally. We conduct an extensive study that combines elicitation of prior expectations before writing, observation and semi-structured interviews during writing, and outcome evaluations after writing. Our results illustrate the individual and situational variation in machine-in-the-loop writing approaches, suggestion acceptance, and ways the system is helpful. Centrally, we report how participants perform integrative leaps, by which they do cognitive work to integrate suggestions of varying semantic relevance into their developing stories. We interpret these findings, offering modeling and design recommendations for future creative writing support technologies.},

abstract = {Recent software advances have led to an expansion of the development and usage of application programming interfaces (APIs). From millions of Android packages (APKs) available on Google Store to millions of open-source packages available in Maven, PyPI, and npm, APIs have become an integral part of software development.Like any software artifact, software APIs evolve and suffer from this evolution. Prior research has uncovered many challenges to the development, usage, and evolution of APIs. While some challenges have been studied and solved, many remain. These challenges are scattered in the literature, which hides advances and cloaks the remaining challenges.In this systematic literature review on APIs and API evolution, we uncover and describe publication trends and trending topics. We compile common research goals, evaluation methods, metrics, and subjects. We summarize the current state-of-the-art and outline known existing challenges as well as new challenges uncovered during this review.We conclude that the main remaining challenges related to APIs and API evolution are (1) automatically identifying and leveraging factors that drive API changes, (2) creating and using uniform benchmarks for research evaluation, and (3) understanding the impact of API evolution on API developers and users with respect to various programming languages.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous technologies such as mobile software applications (mobile apps) have a tremendous influence on the evolution of the social, cultural, economic, and political facets of life in society. Mobile apps fulfil many practical purposes for users including entertainment, transportation, financial management, etc. Given the ubiquity of mobile apps in the lives of individuals and the consequent effect of these technologies on society, it is essential to consider the relationship between human values and the development and deployment of mobile apps. The many negative consequences of violating human values such as privacy, fairness or social justice by technology have been documented in recent times. If we can detect these violations in a timely manner, developers can look to better address them. To understand the violation of human values in a range of common mobile apps, we analysed 22,119 app reviews from Google Play Store using natural language processing techniques. We base our values violation detection approach on a widely accepted model of human values; the Schwartz theory of basic human values. The results of our analysis show that 26.5% of the reviews contained text indicating user perceived violations of human values. We found that benevolence and self-direction were the most violated value categories, and conformity and tradition were the least violated categories. Our results also highlight the need for a proactive approach to the alignment of values amongst stakeholders and the use of app reviews as a valuable additional source for mining values requirements.},

Yet existing discrimination is often the result of unequal social relations, rather than simply an unequal distribution of resources. We show how optimizing for existing computational definitions of fairness fails to prevent unequal social relations by providing an example of a self-confirming equilibrium in a simple hiring market that is relationally unequal but satisfies existing distributional notions of fairness. We introduce a notion of blatant relational unfairness for complete-information games, and discuss how this definition helps initiate a new approach to incorporating relational equality into computational systems.},

abstract = {Emotion recognition technologies, while critiqued for bias, validity, and privacy invasion, continue to be developed and applied in a range of domains including in high-stakes settings like the workplace. We set out to examine emotion recognition technologies proposed for use in the workplace, describing the input data and training, outputs, and actions that these systems take or prompt. We use these design features to reflect on these technologies' implications using the ethical speculation lens. We analyzed patent applications that developed emotion recognition technologies to be used in the workplace (N=86). We found that these technologies scope data collection broadly; claim to reveal not only targets' emotional expressions, but also their internal states; and take or prompt a wide range of actions, many of which impact workers' employment and livelihoods. Technologies described in patent applications frequently violated existing guidelines for ethical automated emotion recognition technology. We demonstrate the utility of using patent applications for ethical speculation. In doing so, we suggest that 1) increasing the visibility of claimed emotional states has the potential to create additional emotional labor for workers (a burden that is disproportionately distributed to low-power and marginalized workers) and contribute to a larger pattern of blurring boundaries between expectations of the workplace and a worker's autonomy, and more broadly to the data colonialism regime; 2) Emotion recognition technology's failures can be invisible, may inappropriately influence high-stakes workplace decisions and can exacerbate inequity. We discuss the implications of making emotions and emotional data visible in the workplace and submit for consideration implications for designers of emotion recognition, employers who use them, and policymakers.},

Hybrid work paradigms have simultaneously created new opportunities for PSAI, but have also fostered anxieties of misuse and privacy intrusions within a power asymmetry. At this juncture, it is unclear if those who are sensed can find these systems acceptable. We conducted scenario-based interviews of 28 information workers to highlight their perspectives as data subjects in PSAI. We unpack their expectations using the Contextual Integrity framework of privacy and information gathering. Participants described appropriateness of PSAI based on its impact on job consequences, work-life boundaries, and preservation of flexibility. They perceived that PSAI inferences could be shared with selected stakeholders if they could negotiate the algorithmic inferences. Our findings help envision worker-centric approaches to implementing PSAI as an empowering tool in the future of work.},

abstract = {Rankings of people and items are at the heart of selection-making, match-making, and recommender systems, ranging from employment sites to sharing economy platforms. As ranking positions influence the amount of attention the ranked subjects receive, biases in rankings can lead to unfair distribution of opportunities and resources such as jobs or income. This paper proposes new measures and mechanisms to quantify and mitigate unfairness from a bias inherent to all rankings, namely, the position bias which leads to disproportionately less attention being paid to low-ranked subjects. Our approach differs from recent fair ranking approaches in two important ways. First, existing works measure unfairness at the level of subject groups while our measures capture unfairness at the level of individual subjects, and as such subsume group unfairness. Second, as no single ranking can achieve individual attention fairness, we propose a novel mechanism that achieves amortized fairness, where attention accumulated across a series of rankings is proportional to accumulated relevance. We formulate the challenge of achieving amortized individual fairness subject to constraints on ranking quality as an online optimization problem and show that it can be solved as an integer linear program. Our experimental evaluation reveals that unfair attention distribution in rankings can be substantial, and demonstrates that our method can improve individual fairness while retaining high ranking quality.},

These practices have been complemented by the use metrics adapted to ASDMs context, generating a large number and types of metrics. Thus, this secondary study presents a Systematic Literature Mapping to understand how agile organizations use metrics. Seven research questions were defined, and 33 primary studies related to the use of agile metrics were selected. The results indicate that most organizations that use agile metrics use Scrum, develop large size general-purpose software products, desktop, or web applications, in small teams. The metrics are selected by primary studies based on literature search, interviews with the team members or expert groups. The majority of the organizations use Product Quality, Resource and Cost, and Process performance metrics, focusing in the agile team, management and customer. The primary studies results indicate that using agile metrics can positively impact the quality of processes, products, and services.},

abstract = {Water Pipeline Monitoring System (WPMS) is extremely important considering the several pipeline damages and the various hydraulic failures that cause a critical water loss. In this context, Cognitive Water Distribution System integrates Internet of Things (IoT) technology, based on smart sensors, actuators and connected objects, with a reliable Big Data processing for smart and robust Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of pipelines. In this paper, we propose a cognitive IoT-based architecture where we used Apache Spark framework to maintain a real time processing of the large amount of collected data. This efficient processing of measured data and its correspondent calculated values simplify the transient simulations and leak detection and make it faster and easier.},

abstract = {Human-AI collaboration for decision-making strives to achieve team performance that exceeds the performance of humans or AI alone. However, many factors can impact success of Human-AI teams, including a user’s domain expertise, mental models of an AI system, trust in recommendations, and more. This article reports on a study that examines users’ interactions with three simulated algorithmic models, all with equivalent accuracy rates but each tuned differently in terms of true positive and true negative rates. Our study examined user performance in a non-trivial blood vessel labeling task where participants indicated whether a given blood vessel was flowing or stalled. Users completed 140 trials across multiple stages, first without an AI and then with recommendations from an AI-Assistant. Although all users had prior experience with the task, their levels of proficiency varied widely.Our results demonstrated that while recommendations from an AI-Assistant can aid in users’ decision making, several underlying factors, including user base expertise and complementary human-AI tuning, significantly impact the overall team performance. First, users’ base performance matters, particularly in comparison to the performance level of the AI. Novice users improved, but not to the accuracy level of the AI. Highly proficient users were generally able to discern when they should follow the AI recommendation and typically maintained or improved their performance. Mid-performers, who had a similar level of accuracy to the AI, were most variable in terms of whether the AI recommendations helped or hurt their performance. Second, tuning an AI algorithm to complement users’ strengths and weaknesses also significantly impacted users’ performance. For example, users in our study were better at detecting flowing blood vessels, so when the AI was tuned to reduce false negatives (at the expense of increasing false positives), users were able to reject those recommendations more easily and improve in accuracy. Finally, users’ perception of the AI’s performance relative to their own performance had an impact on whether users’ accuracy improved when given recommendations from the AI. Overall, this work reveals important insights on the complex interplay of factors influencing Human-AI collaboration and provides recommendations on how to design and tune AI algorithms to complement users in decision-making tasks.},

abstract = {Software history has a deep impact on current software designers, computer scientists, and technologists. System constraints imposed in the past and the designs that responded to them are often unknown or poorly understood by students and practitioners, yet modern software systems often include “old” software and “historical” programming techniques. This work looks at software history through specific software areas to develop student-consumable practices, design principles, lessons learned, and trends useful in current and future software design. It also exposes key areas that are widely used in modern software, yet infrequently taught in computing programs. Written as a textbook, this book uses specific cases from the past and present to explore the impact of software trends and techniques.Building on concepts from the history of science and technology, software history examines such areas as fundamentals, operating systems, programming languages, programming environments, networking, and databases. These topics are covered from their earliest beginnings to their modern variants. There are focused case studies on UNIX, APL, SAGE, GNU Emacs, Autoflow, internet protocols, System R, and others. Extensive problems and suggested projects enable readers to deeply delve into the history of software in areas that interest them most.},

abstract = {Organizations use diverse types of security solutions to prevent cyber-attacks. Multiple vendors provide security solutions developed using heterogeneous technologies and paradigms. Hence, it is a challenging rather impossible to easily make security solutions to work an integrated fashion. Security orchestration aims at smoothly integrating multivendor security tools that can effectively and efficiently interoperate to support security staff of a Security Operation Centre (SOC). Given the increasing role and importance of security orchestration, there has been an increasing amount of literature on different aspects of security orchestration solutions. However, there has been no effort to systematically review and analyze the reported solutions. We report a Multivocal Literature Review that has systematically selected and reviewed both academic and grey (blogs, web pages, white papers) literature on different aspects of security orchestration published from January 2007 until July 2017. The review has enabled us to provide a working definition of security orchestration and classify the main functionalities of security orchestration into three main areas—unification, orchestration, and automation. We have also identified the core components of a security orchestration platform and categorized the drivers of security orchestration based on technical and socio-technical aspects. We also provide a taxonomy of security orchestration based on the execution environment, automation strategy, deployment type, mode of task and resource type. This review has helped us to reveal several areas of further research and development in security orchestration.},

By integrating ideas from crowdsourcing and learning theories focusing on learner-centered pedagogy, this work provides a review and classification of learnersourcing systems from the perspective of its three groups of stakeholders: (1) contributors, who are the learners who contribute new learning artifacts, (2) beneficiaries, who are the learners who learn from these artifacts, and (3) the instructional team who design and deploy learnersourcing tasks. The framework serves as a heuristic device for designing new learnersourcing systems and for considering the broader implications for learnersourcing in terms of workflow design, incentivizing contributors, quality-control, learning outcomes, delivering personalized learning experiences, ethical considerations, and its complementary relationship with AI in education.},

This paper presents our findings on the extrinsic and intrinsic factors linked to toolbuilding, the value of building tools, and the factors associated with tool spread. We find that the majority of developers build tools. While most tools never spread beyond their creator's team, most have more than one user, and many have more than one collaborator. Organizational cultures that are receptive towards toolbuilding produce more tools, and more collaboration on tools. When nurtured and spread, homegrown tools have the potential to create significant impact on organizations.},

Over the course of the research, we found workers engaged in continuous acts of calibration, troubleshooting, and repair required to support AI technologies over time. In interrogating these sites, we develop the concept of "patchwork": human labor that occurs in the space between what AI purports to do and what it actually accomplishes. We argue that it is necessary to consider the often-undervalued frontline work that makes up for AI's shortcomings during implementation, particularly as CSCW increasingly turns to discussions of Human-AI collaboration.},

We investigate the use of game mechanisms in Stack Overflow, an online community organized to resolve computer programming related problems, for which the improvements we seek for bug tracking systems also turn out to be relevant. The results of our Stack Overflow investigation show that its game mechanisms could be used to address these issues by motivating contributors to increase contribution frequency and quality, by filtering useful contributions, and by creating an agile and dependable moderation system. We proceed by mapping these mechanisms to open-source bug tracking systems, and find that most benefits are applicable. Additionally, our results motivate tailoring a reward and reputation system and summarizing bug reports as future directions for increasing the benefits of game mechanisms in bug tracking systems.},

We interviewed and surveyed professional Go players and found that AI has been actively introduced into the Go training process since the advent of AlphaGo. The significant impact of AI-based training was confirmed in a subsequent analysis of 6,292 games in Korean Go tournaments and Elo rating data of 1,362 Go players worldwide. Overall, the tendency of players to make moves similar to those recommended by AI has sharply increased since 2017. The degree to which players’ expected win rates fluctuate during a game has also decreased significantly since 2017. We also found that AI-based training has provided more benefits to senior players and allowed them to achieve Elo ratings higher than those of junior players.},

These systems typically consist of a single static intervention, such as a timer or site blocker, to persuade users to behave in ways consistent with their stated goals. However, static interventions decline in effectiveness over time as users begin to ignore them. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of static interventions to a rotation strategy, where users experience different interventions over time. We built and deployed a browser extension called HabitLab, which features many interventions that the user can enable across social media and other web sites to control their time spent browsing. We ran three in-the-wild field experiments on HabitLab to compare static interventions to rotated interventions. We found that rotating between interventions increased effectiveness as measured by time on site, but also increased attrition: more users uninstalled HabitLab. To minimize attrition, we introduced a just-in-time information design about rotation. This design reduced attrition rates by half. With this research, we suggest that interaction design, paired with rotation of behavior change interventions, can help users gain control of their online habits.},

The public accessibility of such networks with the ability to share opinions, thoughts, information, and experience offers great promise to enterprises and governments. In addition to individuals using such networks to connect to their friends and families, governments and enterprises have started exploiting these platforms for delivering their services to citizens and customers. However, the success of such attempts relies on the level of trust that members have with each other as well as with the service provider. Therefore, trust becomes an essential and important element of a successful social network. In this article, we present the first comprehensive review of social and computer science literature on trust in social networks. We first review the existing definitions of trust and define social trust in the context of social networks. We then discuss recent works addressing three aspects of social trust: trust information collection, trust evaluation, and trust dissemination. Finally, we compare and contrast the literature and identify areas for further research in social trust.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a method to measure the daily face-to-face social activity of a camera wearer by detecting faces captured in first-person view lifelogging videos. This study was inspired by pedometers used to estimate the amount of physical activity by counting the number of steps detected by accelerometers, which is effective for reflecting individual health and facilitating behavior change. We investigated whether we can estimate the amount of social activity by counting the number of faces captured in the first-person view videos like a pedometer. Our system counts not only the number of faces but also weighs in the numbers according to the size of the face (corresponding to a face's closeness) and the amount of time it was shown in the video. By doing so, we confirmed that we can measure the amount of social activity based on the quality of each interaction. For example, if we simply count the number of faces, we overestimate social activities while passing through a crowd of people. Our system, on the other hand, gives a higher score to a social actitivity even when speaking with a single person for a long time, which was also positively evaluated by experiment participants who viewed the lifelogging videos. Through evaluation experiments, many evaluators evaluated the social activity high when the camera wearer speaks. An interesting feature of the proposed system is that it can correctly evaluate such scenes higher as the camera wearer actively engages in conversations with others, even though the system does not measure the camera wearer's utterances. This is because the conversation partners tend to turn their faces towards to the camera wearer, and that increases the number of detected faces as a result. However, the present system fails to correctly estimate the depth of social activity compared to what the camera wearer recalls especially when the conversation partners are standing out of the camera's field of view. The paper briefly descibes how the results can be improved by widening the camera's field of view.},

Complex experiences of anxiety vary on multiple characteristics, including triggers, responses, duration and severity, and impact differently on the risk of anxiety disorders.

Its originality lies in the synthesis and interpretation of consistently discovered heterogeneous predictors of anxiety and multimodal-multisensor analytics based on them. We reveal that few anxiety characteristics have been evaluated using multimodal-multisensor metrics, and many of the identified predictive features are confounded. As such, objective anxiety assessments are not yet complete or precise. That said, few multimodal-multisensor systems evaluated indicate an approximately 11.73% performance gain compared to unimodal systems, highlighting a promising powerful tool. We suggest six high-priority future directions to address the current gaps and limitations in infrastructure, basic knowledge, and application areas. Action in these directions will expedite the discovery of rich, accurate, continuous, and objective assessments and their use in impactful end-user applications.},

abstract = {The accelerated adoption of digital technologies by people and communities results in a close relation between, on one hand, the state of individual and societal well-being and, on the other hand, the state of the digital technologies that underpin our life experiences. The ethical concerns and questions about the impact of such technologies on human well-being become more crucial when data analytics and intelligent competences are integrated. To investigate how learning technologies could impact human well-being considering the promising and concerning roles of learning analytics, we apply the initial phase of the recently produced IEEE P7010 Well-being Impact Assessment, a methodology and a set of metrics, to allow the digital well-being of a set of educational technologies to be more comprehensively tackled and evaluated. We posit that the use of IEEE P7010 well-being metrics could help identify where educational technologies supported by learning analytics would increase or decrease well-being, providing new routes to future technological innovation in Learning Analytics research.},

To understand how individuals managing depression conceptualize their self-management activities, we conducted visual elicitations and semi-structured interviews with 30 participants managing depression in a large city in the U.S. Midwest. Many depression support tools are focused on the individual user and do not often incorporate social features. However, our analysis showed the key importance of sociality for self-management of depression. We describe how individuals connect with specific others to achieve expected support and how these interactions are mediated through locations and communication channels. We discuss factors influencing participants' sociality including relationship roles and expectations, mood state and communication channels, location and privacy, and culture and society. We broaden our understanding of sociality in CSCW through discussing diffuse sociality (being proximate to others but not interacting directly) as an important activity to support depression self-management.},

abstract = {DevOps is a new approach to drive a seamless Application (App) cycle from development to delivery. As a critical part to promote the successful implementation of DevOps, testing can significantly improve team productivity and reliably deliver user experience. However, it is difficult to use traditional testing to cover diverse mobile phones, network environments, operating systems, and so on. Hence, many large companies crowdsource their App testing tasks to workers from open platforms. In crowdsourced testing, test reports submitted by workers may be highly redundant, and their quality may vary sharply. Meanwhile, multi-bug test reports may be submitted, and their root causes are hard to diagnose. Hence, it is a time-consuming and tedious task for developers to manually inspect these test reports. To help developers address the above challenges, we issue the new problem of Fuzzy Clustering Test Reports (FULTER). Aiming to resolve FULTER, a series of barriers need to be overcome. In this study, we propose a new framework named Test Report Fuzzy Clustering Framework (TERFUR) by aggregating redundant and multi-bug test reports into clusters to reduce the number of inspected test reports. First, we construct a filter to remove invalid test reports to break through the invalid barrier. Then, a preprocessor is built to enhance the descriptions of short test reports to break through the uneven barrier. Last, a two-phase merging algorithm is proposed to partition redundant and multi-bug test reports into clusters that can break through the multi-bug barrier. Experimental results over 1,728 test reports from five industrial Apps show that TERFUR can cluster test reports by up to 78.15% in terms of AverageP, 78.41% in terms of AverageR, and 75.82% in terms of AverageF1 and outperform comparative methods by up to 31.69%, 33.06%, and 24.55%, respectively. In addition, the effectiveness of TERFUR is validated in prioritizing test reports for manual inspection.},

abstract = {Software history has a deep impact on current software designers, computer scientists, and technologists. System constraints imposed in the past and the designs that responded to them are often unknown or poorly understood by students and practitioners, yet modern software systems often include “old” software and “historical” programming techniques. This work looks at software history through specific software areas to develop student-consumable practices, design principles, lessons learned, and trends useful in current and future software design. It also exposes key areas that are widely used in modern software, yet infrequently taught in computing programs. Written as a textbook, this book uses specific cases from the past and present to explore the impact of software trends and techniques.Building on concepts from the history of science and technology, software history examines such areas as fundamentals, operating systems, programming languages, programming environments, networking, and databases. These topics are covered from their earliest beginnings to their modern variants. There are focused case studies on UNIX, APL, SAGE, GNU Emacs, Autoflow, internet protocols, System R, and others. Extensive problems and suggested projects enable readers to deeply delve into the history of software in areas that interest them most.}

abstract = {Adaptive Case Management (ACM) is a new paradigm that facilitates the coordination of knowledge work through case handling. Current ACM systems, however, lack support of providing sophisticated user guidance for next step recommendations and predictions about the case future. In recent years, process mining research developed approaches to make recommendations and predictions based on event logs readily available in process-aware information systems. This paper builds upon those approaches and integrates them into an existing ACM solution. The research goal is to design and develop a prototype that gives next step recommendations and predictions based on process mining techniques in ACM systems. The models proposed, recommend actions that shorten the case running time, mitigate deadline transgressions, support case goals and have been used in former cases with similar properties. They further give case predictions about the remaining time, possible deadline violations, and whether the current case path supports given case goals. A final evaluation proves that the prototype is indeed capable of making proper recommendations and predictions. In addition, starting points for further improvement are discussed.},

Unlike previous attempts, this interactive storytelling system places no restrictions on the content or direction of the user’s contribution to the emerging storyline. In response to these contributions, the computer continues the storyline with narration that is both coherent and entertaining. This capacity for open-domain interactive storytelling is enabled by an extremely large repository of nonfiction personal stories, which is used as a knowledge base in a case-based reasoning architecture. In this article, we describe the three main components of our case-based reasoning approach: a million-item corpus of personal stories mined from internet weblogs, a case retrieval strategy that is optimized for narrative coherence, and an adaptation strategy that ensures that repurposed sentences from the case base are appropriate for the user’s emerging fiction. We describe a series of evaluations of the system’s ability to produce coherent and entertaining stories, and we compare these narratives with single-author stories posted to internet weblogs.},

abstract = {Interpersonal conflict in code review, such as toxic language or an unnecessary pushback, is associated with negative outcomes such as stress and turnover. Automatic detection is one approach to prevent and mitigate interpersonal conflict. Two recent automatic detection approaches were developed in different settings: a toxicity detector using text analytics for open source issue discussions and a pushback detector using logs-based metrics for corporate code reviews. This paper tests how the toxicity detector and the pushback detector can be generalized beyond their respective contexts and discussion types, and how the combination of the two can help improve interpersonal conflict detection. The results reveal connections between the two concepts.Software engineers often communicate with one another on platforms that support tasks like discussing bugs and inspecting each others' code. Such discussions sometimes contain interpersonal conflict, which can lead to stress and abandonment. In this paper, we investigate how to automatically detect interpersonal conflict, both by analyzing the text of the what the engineers are saying and by analyzing the properties of that text.},

Hence, changes in UX occur over time, according to the different contexts, and behavioral and internal user aspects. With the rising development of Internet of Things (IoT) systems to support daily activities and, at the same time, the increasing abandonment of these systems, the importance of ensuring good UX levels over time has become an even greater need. In this context, we conducted a snowballing procedure and systematic literature mapping to understand whether and how long-term UX evaluations have been conducted in IoT and the challenges and opportunities in conducting longitudinal studies in this field. We analyzed 55 papers that reported longitudinal evaluations in different IoT systems and 14 papers that reported UX evaluations in the IoT context. We also interviewed five software engineering professionals to learn about their IoT user-testing and evaluation perspectives. Our results provide a panorama of the conduction of longitudinal IoT studies and a glance at the directions the research on UX evaluation for IoT systems is taking. Hence, we indicate future research opportunities for evaluating long-term UX in IoT systems through the longitudinal approach, considering the complexity of these systems and their impact on users' everyday lives.},

Previous work suggests that within mainstream platforms, community-level moderation is effective in mitigating the harm caused by the moderated communities. It is, however, unclear whether these results also hold when considering the broader Web ecosystem. Do toxic communities continue to grow in terms of their user base and activity on the new platforms? Do their members become more toxic and ideologically radicalized? In this paper, we report the results of a large-scale observational study of how problematic online communities progress following community-level moderation measures. We analyze data from r/The_Donald and r/Incels, two communities that were banned from Reddit and subsequently migrated to their own standalone websites. Our results suggest that, in both cases, moderation measures significantly decreased posting activity on the new platform, reducing the number of posts, active users, and newcomers. In spite of that, users in one of the studied communities (r/The_Donald) showed increases in signals associated with toxicity and radicalization, which justifies concerns that the reduction in activity may come at the expense of a more toxic and radical community. Overall, our results paint a nuanced portrait of the consequences of community-level moderation and can inform their design and deployment.},

Developers need to choose an update strategy that allows them to receive important updates and fixes while protecting them from breaking changes. Semantic Versioning was proposed to address this dilemma, but many have opted for more restrictive or permissive alternatives. This empirical study explores the association between package characteristics and the dependency update strategy selected by its dependents to understand how developers select and change their update strategies. We study over 112,000 Node Package Manager (npm) packages and use 19 characteristics to build a prediction model that identifies the common dependency update strategy for each package. Our model achieves a minimum improvement of 72% over the baselines and is much better aligned with community decisions than the npm default strategy. We investigate how different package characteristics can influence the predicted update strategy and find that dependent count, age, and release status to be the highest influencing features. We complement the work with qualitative analyses of 160 packages to investigate the evolution of update strategies. While the common update strategy remains consistent for many packages, certain events such as the release of the 1.0.0 version or breaking changes influence the selected update strategy over time.},

Usually, there is a medium of expression called "code" that the human(s) use to express desired behavior on the part of the computer, and the computer provides its feedback in the form of textual, graphical, audio, or other output. The most popular domain for live programming has been music synthesis ("live coding"), but the key features of live programming suggest it can play an important role in other applications, even process control or emergency management. This paper breaks down live programming systems in terms of agents, both human and computational, their roles, and representations they typically create and act upon. It then comments on how multi-agent live programming systems could add new flexibility to information systems such as those that manage critical infrastructure or emergency response activity, such as during a COVID-19 type of pandemic or after a major earthquake.},

The silver bullet for a successful application of sentiment analysis tools to SE datasets might be their customization to the specific usage context.We describe our experience in building a software library recommender exploiting developers' opinions mined from Stack Overflow. To reach our goal, we retrained---on a set of 40k manually labeled sentences/words extracted from Stack Overflow---a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis tool exploiting deep learning. Despite such an effort- and time-consuming training process, the results were negative. We changed our focus and performed a thorough investigation of the accuracy of commonly used tools to identify the sentiment of SE related texts. Meanwhile, we also studied the impact of different datasets on tool performance. Our results should warn the research community about the strong limitations of current sentiment analysis tools.},

abstract = {Public media and researchers in different areas have recently focused on perhaps unexpected problems that derive from an excessive and frequent use of technology, giving rise to a new kind of psychological “digital” wellbeing. Such a novel and pressing topic has fostered, both in the academia and in the industry, the emergence of a variety of digital self-control tools allowing users to self-regulate their technology use through interventions like timers and lock-out mechanisms. While these emerging technologies for behavior change hold great promise to support people’s digital wellbeing, we still have a limited understanding of their real effectiveness, as well as of how to best design and evaluate them. Aiming to guide future research in this important domain, this article presents a systematic review and a meta-analysis of current work on tools for digital self-control. We surface motivations, strategies, design choices, and challenges that characterize the design, development, and evaluation of digital self-control tools. Furthermore, we estimate their overall effect size on reducing (unwanted) technology use through a meta-analysis. By discussing our findings, we provide insights on how to (i) overcome a limited perspective that exclusively focuses on technology overuse and self-monitoring tools, (ii) evaluate digital self-control tools through long-term studies and standardized measures, and (iii) bring ethics in the digital wellbeing discourse and deal with the business model of contemporary tech companies.},

abstract = {The increased adoption of smart home cameras (SHCs) foregrounds issues of surveillance, power, and privacy in homes and neighborhoods. However, questions remain about how people are currently using these devices to monitor and surveil, what the benefits and limitations are for users, and what privacy and security tensions arise between primary users and other stakeholders. We present an empirical study with 14 SHC users to understand how these devices are used and integrated within everyday life. Based on semi-structured qualitative interviews, we investigate users’ motivations, practices, privacy concerns, and social negotiations. Our findings highlight the SHC as a perceptually powerful and spatially sensitive device that enables a variety of surveillant uses outside of basic home security—from formally surveilling domestic workers, to casually spying on neighbors, to capturing memories. We categorize surveillant SHC uses, clarify distinctions between primary and non-primary users, and highlight under-considered design directions for addressing power imbalances among primary and non-primary users.},

And this process includes both bibliometric and text mining analysis. We examine the impact of factors such as variations across publication years, the contribution of different countries, keywords statistics and most cited references. Next this study summarizes and analyses the theoretical conceptions of knowledge management which include definitions and stages about knowledge management. Then we review some major apporaches for designing the knowledge management system from different perspective including information technology tools, knowledge representation and organization, knowledge sharing, performance measure for knowledge management and intelligent applications for knowledge management. At last we investigate the major research trends in knowledge management and give some recommendations for future research of knowledge management.},

abstract = {This paper presents a specific man-in-the-middle exploit: Ambient Tactical Deception (ATD) in online communication, realized via a malicious web browser extension. Extensions manipulate web content in unobtrusive ways as ambient intermediaries of the overall browsing experience. In our previous work, we demonstrated that it is possible to employ tactical deception by making covert changes in the text content of a web page, regardless of the source. In this work, we investigated the application of ATD in a web-based email discourse where the objective is to manipulate the interpersonal perception without the knowledge of the involved parties. We focus on web-based email text because it is asynchronous and usually revised for clarity and politeness. Previous research has demonstrated that people's perception of politeness in online communication is based on three factors: the degree of imposition, the power of the receiver over the sender, and the social distance between them. We interviewed participants about their perception of these factors to establish the plausibility of ATD for email discourse. The results indicate that by covertly altering the politeness strategy in an email, it is possible for an ATD attacker to manipulate the receiver's perception on all of the politeness factors. Our findings support the Brown and Levinson's politeness theory and Walther's hyperpersonal model of email communication.},

At the same time, a detailed understanding of interruptions in settings where people wearing an HMD (HMD user) and people not wearing an HMD (bystander) is missing. We investigate (a) whether bystanders are capable of identifying when HMD users switch tasks by observing their gestures, and hence exploit opportune moments for interruptions, and (b) which strategies bystanders employ. In a lab study (N=64) we found that bystanders are able to successfully identify both task switches (83%) and tasks (77%) within only a few seconds of the task switch. Furthermore, we identified interruption strategies of bystanders. From our results we derive implications meant to support designers and practitioners in building HMD applications that are used in a co-located collaborative setting.},

Characterizing the Web content and predicting its inherent usefulness become important problems that may benefit many applications such as information filtering and content recommendation. In this article, we present a brief review of the existing measurements and the corresponding prediction methods for Web content utility. Specially, we focus on three close and widely studied tasks, i.e., content popularity prediction, content quality prediction, and scientific article impact prediction. While reviewing the existing work in each of the above three tasks, we mainly aim to answer the following two fundamental questions: how to measure the Web content utility, and how to make the predictions under the measurement. We find that while the three tasks are closely related, they bear subtle differences in terms of prediction urgency, feature extraction, and algorithm design. After that, we discuss some future directions in measuring and predicting Web content utility},

abstract = {Task-oriented chatbots allow users to carry out tasks (e.g., ordering a pizza) using natural language conversation. The widely-used slot-filling approach for building bots of this type requires significant hand-coding, which hinders scalability. Recently, neural network models have been shown to be capable of generating natural "chitchat" conversations, but it is unclear whether they will ever work for task modeling. Kite is a practical system for bootstrapping task-oriented bots, leveraging both approaches above. Kite's key insight is that while bots encapsulate the logic of user tasks into conversational forms, existing apps encapsulate the logic of user tasks into graphical user interfaces. A developer demonstrates a task using a relevant app, and from the collected interaction traces Kite automatically derives a task model, a graph of actions and associated inputs representing possible task execution paths. A task model represents the logical backbone of a bot, on which Kite layers a question-answer interface generated using a hybrid rule-based and neural network approach. Using Kite, developers can automatically generate bot templates for many different tasks. In our evaluation, it extracted accurate task models from 25 popular Android apps spanning 15 tasks. Appropriate questions and high-quality answers were also generated. Our developer study suggests that developers, even without any bot developing experience, can successfully generate bot templates using Kite.},

We focused on the influence of activity contexts, characterized by breakpoint situations and activity attributes. In line with their stated preferences, the participants were more likely to proactively perform mobile crowdsourcing tasks during transitions between activities than during an ongoing activity and during long breaks, respectively. Their task choices were influenced by various activity attributes, and more impacted by their current and preceding activities than their upcoming ones. Two of our three target outcomes, task execution and task choice, were also influenced by individuals’ stress and energy levels. Our qualitative data provide further insights into participants’ decisions about which crowdsourcing tasks to perform and when; and our results’ implications for the design of future mobile crowdsourcing task-prompting mechanisms are also discussed.},

This paper examines how initiators of smart technology insert their vision of the good life into households, and how these technologies exert power over the residents. Through a thematic analysis of interviews with five households, we consider Foucault’s theory on disciplinary power to examine how smart home technologies shape the experience of the home by shifting the flow of information and thereby reify power structures. Results indicate that the implementation of smart technology can affect access to shared spaces, constrain interactions, and predefine practices thereby establishing hierarchies within the household. We turn the discussion towards ethical challenges concerning control, whose problems the smart home is concerned with, and how the smart home embeds itself in the household. We conclude with design considerations and future work.},

year = {2015},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Applying code changes to software systems and testing these code changes can be a complex task that involves many different types of software testing strategies, e.g. system and integration tests. However, not all test failures reported during code integration are hinting towards code defects. Testing large systems such as the Microsoft Windows operating system requires complex test infrastructures, which may lead to test failures caused by faulty tests and test infrastructure issues. Such false test alarms are particular annoying as they raise engineer attention and require manual inspection without providing any benefit. The goal of this work is to use empirical data to minimize the number of false test alarms reported during system and integration testing. To achieve this goal, we use association rule learning to identify patterns among failing test steps that are typically for false test alarms and can be used to automatically classify them. A successful classification of false test alarms is particularly valuable for product teams as manual test failure inspection is an expensive and time-consuming process that not only costs engineering time and money but also slows down product development. We evaluating our approach on system and integration tests executed during Windows 8.1 and Microsoft Dynamics AX development. Performing more than 10,000 classifications for each product, our model shows a mean precision between 0.85 and 0.90 predicting between 34% and 48% of all false test alarms.},

abstract = {Public cloud platforms provide an amazing set of capabilities, but it can be an overwhelming challenge to create a design, implementation, and deployment that properly leverages today's existing public cloud capabilities while not precluding the use of near-future new services and infrastructure. We tackle this challenge in the context of clinical data registries, and create Cloud-based Patient Outcomes Platform (CPOP), our scalable public cloud application for clinical patient data. Doctors are able to visualize collected medical data in different chart formats and patients are able to check their data and submit medical survey forms. The specific domain of interest in this paper is Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS), a largely under-recognized chronic disease in our society. The primary barrier to quality improvement in CRS is the difficulty in collecting data from patients, tracking appropriate follow-up time intervals, and analyzing outcomes results in a prospective and ongoing fashion. We describe key aspects and design experiences of CPOP-CRS in Amazon Web Services.We also provide quantitative evaluation of a key feature of CPOP-CRS, which is the ability of CRS doctors to upload an audio clip of a doctor-patient interaction, and have the cloud render a text-based representation, and show a word error rate of 15.6%. We outline next steps in the development of the CPOP/CPOP-CRS, and provide guidance for other users considering the public cloud for their next parallel and cloud-based Bioinformatics and Biomedicine project.},

abstract = {Nowadays the Web and Web browsers have become the most important and universal platform for people to search, view, process, and exchange various kinds of information. Consequently, today's users usually open many Web pages simultaneously in order to perform multiple tasks in parallel, which makes Web browsers crucial in our daily task management. However, no existing Web browser provides users with sufficient support for the management of many tabs or windows of opened pages. On the other hand, wide displays have become more affordable and prevalent, while extra space on those displays is not utilized effectively in Web browsing. In this paper, we propose a new Web browser interface aiming to support efficient task management in Web browsing on wide displays. In order to help users switch between opened Web pages, we show thumbnails of the pages in the extra space around the currently focused page. In the page thumbnails, we emphasize distinctive elements in each page in order to make the selection of the thumbnails easier. In addition, we calculate the relevance between pages based on users' switching history, and emphasize pages relevant to the current page by adjusting the size or opacity of the thumbnails. This further helps users find the thumbnails of needed pages, and also helps users get the overview of the page set related to the current task.},

abstract = {Academic research, by its nature, is notorious for being a challenging and demanding field. However, these challenges may become more complicated for certain groups of researchers rather than others. For instance, junior researchers who make up a large group of the current scientific community, particularly in the computer science domain, may face various types of impediments. A notable hindrance to realizing the impediments is the difficulty of precisely delineating them. In this paper, we report an empirical investigation to measure the level of awareness of any kind of obstacles that might hinder junior researchers’ publishing ability and disturb their involvement. For this purpose, we conducted a survey targeting active researchers from the Software Engineering field with a total of 52 respondents. We mainly focus on two types of aspects: peer reviewing models and collaboration. Our findings indicate that junior researchers seem to be more comfortable with double-blind reviewing models with more than half (approximately 67.2%) of them voting in favor of this model. The results also show a significant agreement that a lack of experience especially in academic writing and supervision problems constitute the most influential barriers to publishing. Our findings can help understand the needs of junior researchers and provide insights into our research community and its specific groups.},

abstract = {The Handbook of Multimodal-Multisensor Interfaces provides the first authoritative resource on what has become the dominant paradigm for new computer interfaces-user input involving new media (speech, multi-touch, gestures, writing) embedded in multimodal-multisensor interfaces. These interfaces support smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle, robotic, and many other applications that are now highly competitive commercially. This edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the field. It provides a textbook for students, and a reference and technology roadmap for professionals working in this rapidly emerging area. Volume 1 of the handbook presents relevant theory and neuroscience foundations for guiding the development of high-performance systems. Additional chapters discuss approaches to user modeling, interface design that supports user choice, synergistic combination of modalities with sensors, and blending of multimodal input and output. They also highlight an in-depth look at the most common multimodal-multisensor combinations- for example, touch and pen input, haptic and non-speech audio output, and speech co-processed with visible lip movements, gaze, gestures, or pen input. A common theme throughout is support for mobility and individual differences among users-including the world's rapidly growing population of seniors. These handbook chapters provide walk-through examples and video illustrations of different system designs and their interactive use. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal-multisensor systems. In the final chapter, experts exchange views on a timely and controversial challenge topic, and how they believe multimodal-multisensor interfaces should be designed in the future to most effectively advance human performance.}

In this paper, we present a new type of human-computer collaborative editing tool (CET) that enables accurate and efficient editing with little interaction effort. CET divides the task into two parts, and the human and the computer focus on their respective specialties: the human describes high-level editing goals with multimodal commands, while the computer calculates, recommends, and performs detailed operations. We conducted a formative study (N = 16) to determine the concrete task division and implemented the tool on Android devices for the specific tasks of editing concept diagrams. The user study (N = 24 + 20) showed that it increased diagram editing speed by 32.75% compared with existing state-of-the-art commercial tools and led to better editing results and user experience.},

abstract = {During maintenance, developers often need to understand the purpose of a test. One of the most potentially useful sources of information for understanding a test is its name. Ideally, test names are descriptive in that they accurately summarize both the scenario and the expected outcome of the test. Despite the benefits of being descriptive, test names often fall short of this goal. In this paper we present a new approach for automatically generating descriptive names for existing test bodies. Using a combination of natural-language program analysis and text generation, the technique creates names that summarize the test's scenario and the expected outcome. The results of our evaluation show that, (1) compared to alternative approaches, the names generated by our technique are significantly more similar to human-generated names and are nearly always preferred by developers, (2) the names generated by our technique are preferred over or are equivalent to the original test names in 83% of cases, and (3) our technique is several orders of magnitude faster than manually writing test names.},

Treating mental disorders has become a client-oriented, goal setting practice in which therapists work with their clients to set, monitor and support goals that reinforce client self-monitoring and self-assessment in combination with recovery-based therapeutic techniques. While m-Health technologies are beginning to help shape the therapist-client recovery process, little research has been done to develop explicit design considerations for such technologies, particularly in the area of mental health. Our contribution to m-Health research is the articulation of technology design consideration for both design process and design principles. Based on semi-structured interview data gathered from six occupational therapists, we sought to understand where the gaps lay in therapist-client interaction and communication, particularly in the everyday activities of the client that exist outside of a therapy session. This data helped us to understand opportunities for technological support for recovery. Our data helped us to discover and outline the challenges occupational therapists experience when supporting their clients with mental disorders through the recovery process. Our analysis of therapist-client design opportunities can provide insight to assist with the development of more effective m-Health technologies for people with mental disorders.},

We applied a suite of structure and history measures and statistically analyzed the correlations between them. We detected architecture issues by identifying outliers in the distributions of measured values and investigating the architectural significance of the associated classes. We used a clustering method to identify sets of files that often change together without being structurally close together, investigating whether architecture issues were among the root causes. The development team confirmed that the identified clusters reflected significant architectural violations, unstable key interfaces, and important undocumented assumptions shared between modules. The combined structure diagrams and history data justified a refactoring proposal that was accepted by the project manager and implemented.},

abstract = {Mobile devices have become an increasingly ubiquitous part of our everyday life. We use mobile services to perform a broad range of tasks (e.g. booking travel or office work), leading to often lengthy interactions within distinct apps and services. Existing mobile systems handle mostly simple user needs, where a single app is taken as the unit of interaction. To understand users' expectations and to provide context-aware services, it is important to model users' interactions in the task space. In this work, we first propose and evaluate a method for the automated segmentation of users' app usage logs into task units. We focus on two problems: (i) given a sequential pair of app usage logs, identify if there exists a task boundary, and (ii) given any pair of two app usage logs, identify if they belong to the same task. We model these as classification problems that use features from three aspects of app usage patterns: temporal, similarity, and log sequence. Our classifiers improve on traditional timeout segmentation, achieving over 89% performance for both problems. Secondly, we use our best task classifier on a large-scale data set of commercial mobile app usage logs to identify common tasks. We observe that users' performed common tasks ranging from regular information checking to entertainment and booking dinner. Our proposed task identification approach provides the means to evaluate mobile services and applications with respect to task completion.},

In fields such as HCI and AI, however, these approaches were not yet employed for supporting users to create different forms of artworks, like a musical corpus. While allowing novel forms of interactivity with partially-autonomous systems, these techniques could also foster the emergence of artworks not limited to experts. Hence, in this paper we introduce the concept of meta-interactivity for compositional interfaces, which extends an individual's capabilities by the translation of an effort into a proficiency. We present how this approach can be effective through a novel system that enables non-experts to compose coherent musical pieces through the use of imagetic elements in a virtual environment. We conduct experiments with a population of musical experts and non-experts, showing that non-experts were able to learn and create high-quality musical productions through our interactive approach.},

abstract = {With the improvement of residents' consumption level, consumers' demand for all kinds of imported consumer goods has gradually increased, but its quality problem can not be ignored. The quality governance of consumer goods is particularly important, which is a part of social co-governance. It emphasizes the joint participation and responsibility to quality of multiple-subject, such as media, government, enterprises, social groups and the public. In the Internet age, social media is playing an increasingly important role in the reporting of various major event relative to commodity quality. Therefore, the research on the quality attention of imported consumer goods based on text mining to online news can be regarded as a valuable exploration. In this paper, using 3 identified standards —— news authority, news crawling volume and website traffic, we select 2 news platforms, i.e., China Quality News Network as well as Global Textile Network which have the most synthesis advantages to be qualified publishing quality news of imported consumer goods. Then, text mining on online news related to imported garments quality has been conducted by Python through the following efforts: (1) Garments’ quality dictionaries including quality attribution and quality scoring, has been developed by ourselves. (2) This paper verifies the rationality of the dictionary by using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) in Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The average accuracy on the training data set of the quality attribution dictionary is as high as 93.49%, showing that the selective attribution indexes in the quality attribution dictionary is rational. (3) From the above-mentioned news platforms, all the news relative to garments’ quality until September 10, 2020, has been crawled. There are 10780 crawled news totally, in which 8534 are effective news selected by removing duplicate and other data preprocessing methods. (4) On the basis of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, the 33 quality attributions in the dictionary have been divided into 4 categories: Physiological need attribution, Safety attribution, Functional attribution, Cognitive &amp; aesthetic attribution. Text analysis has been made to the media attention about quality of imported consumer goods from the 4 categories , and time series analysis has also been made. (5) The media quality score of quality attribution has been calculated and analysed.)6) A correlation analysis of the media attention and score of each attribute category has been conducted.The results come to the following conclusions: (1) Different platforms basically share the same concern on the attribution quality of imported garments. The top five quality attributions with high media attention are harmful substances, typical mechanical &amp; physical properties, logo, aesthetic, and comfort. The above 5 quality attributions mainly belong to the safety attribution and cognitive &amp; aesthetic attribution. (2) The higher quality score, the higher media attention, and the worse the quality of imported garments. The media attention on the quality of imported garments experienced four stages: the sustained level stage (2001-2003), the slow growth stage(2003-2012), the rapid growth stage (2012-2014)and sustained pullback stage(2014-2019). (3) Media attention has high correlation to the quality of quality score of imported garments. (4) From 2014 to the present, the attributions quality of imported garments from low to high are Safety attribution, Cognitive &amp; aesthetic attribution, Functional attribution, Physiological need attribution, which lead to the media attention to the attributions from high to low are Safety attribution, Cognitive &amp; aesthetic attribution, Functional attribution, Physiological need attribution. (5) During the period of the rapid growth stage (2012-2014), the totality quality of imported garments declined significantly, give rise to the media attention also increased significantly. (6) After 2014, the totality quality of imported garments showed a trend of gradual improvement, and then the media attention of imported clothing quality was also declining. (7) The quality of safety attribution changes the most, but it improves the fastest.According to the analysis of this paper, media attention has a very close relationship with the quality score of imported garments. The more serious the quality problems, the more media attention would be drawn to them. The high media attention quality attributes need more attention of government to strengthen quality supervision. Finally, this paper puts forward some suggestions on the quality governance of imported consumer goods.},

To capture these experiences, emotion researchers often give participants smartphone applications with various graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to record how they are feeling, however, there exist few empirical tests that assess the comparative benefits and drawbacks of different GUI designs. This paper presents two empirical evaluations of three types of GUI designs for capturing emotion using both a 10 participant in-lab trial and a 100 participant AMT trial. We define GUI scoring metrics and report on participants' ability to rate real world scenarios and evocative images, respectively, in ways that are consistent with population norms and with respect their own emotion word choices. We additionally report on users preferences for different designs, their perceived ease of use and the average time taken to complete an assessment for the different designs.},

abstract = {Enabling students to evaluate the impacts of computing on their own lives and on society is an internationally proclaimed goal of secondary computing education. The literature and existing curricula provide no shortage of various example impacts and contexts, but how these relate to each other, and what, if anything, constitutes their common conceptual core, remains largely unclear. As of yet there exists no coherent and actionable educational model for computing impacts. Such a model is necessary, however, for a consistent and sustainable development of related competency. Based on extant literature and data from 35 interviews, this paper proposes a grounded-theory model of computing impacts for secondary education. It identifies and defines various impact-related concepts which, I argue, can provide a basis for student assessment, can inform the selection of teaching examples and, above all, can facilitate the abstraction and transfer of impact-related knowledge across contexts and artifacts.},

User reviews provide an effective channel to address this question. However, most existing review summarization tools treat reviews as bags-of-words (i.e., mixed review categories) and are limited to extract software aspects and user preferences.We present a novel review summarization framework, SUR-Miner. Instead of a bags-of-words assumption, it classifies reviews into five categories and extracts aspects in sentences which include evaluation of aspect using a pattern-based parser. Then, SUR-Miner visualizes the summaries using two interactive diagrams. Our evaluation on 17 popular apps shows that SUR-Miner summarizes more accurate and clearer aspects than state-of-the-art techniques, with an average F1-score of 0.81, significantly greater than that of ReviewSpotlight (0.56) and Guzmans' method (0.55). Feedback from developers shows that 88% developers agreed with the usefulness of the summaries from SUR-Miner.},

The communities responsible for building this cyberinfrastructure require maintenance and moderation, which is often supported by volunteer efforts. Moderation, as a non-technical form of labor, is a necessary but often overlooked task that maintainers undertake to sustain the community around an OSS project. This study examines the various structures and norms that support community moderation, describes the strategies moderators use to mitigate conflicts, and assesses how bots can play a role in assisting these processes. We interviewed 14 practitioners to uncover existing moderation practices and ways that automation can provide assistance. Our main contributions include a characterization of moderated content in OSS projects, moderation techniques, as well as perceptions of and recommendations for improving the automation of moderation tasks. We hope that these findings will inform the implementation of more effective moderation practices in open source communities.},

While there have been significant technical advances in blocking phishing attacks, end-users remain the last line of defence after phishing emails reach their email inboxes. Most of the existing literature on this subject has focused on the technical aspects related to phishing. The factors that cause humans to be susceptible to phishing attacks are still not well-understood. To fill this gap, we reviewed the available literature and systematically categorized the phishing susceptibility variables studied. We classify variables based on their temporal scope, which led us to propose a three-stage Phishing Susceptibility Model (PSM) for explaining how humans are vulnerable to phishing attacks. This model reveals several research gaps that need to be addressed to understand and improve protection against phishing susceptibility. Our review also systematizes existing studies by their sample size and generalizability and further suggests a practical impact assessment of the value of studying variables: Some more easily lead to improvements than others. We believe that this article can provide guidelines for future phishing susceptibility research to improve experiment design and the quality of findings.},

abstract = {Graphical Adaptive Menus are Graphical User Interface menus whose predicted items of immediate use can be automatically rendered in a prediction window. Rendering this prediction window is a key question for adaptivity to enable the end-user to efficiently differentiate predicted items from normal ones and to consequently select appropriate items. Adaptivity for graphical menus has been investigated more for normal screens, such as desktops, than for small screens, such as smartphones, where real estate imposes severe rendering constraints. To address this question, this article defines and explores a design space where graphical adaptive menus are structured based on Bertin’s eight visual variables (i.e., position, size, shape, value, color, orientation, texture, and motion) and their combination by comparing their rendering for small screens with respect to normal screens. Based on this design space, previously introduced graphical adaptive menus are revisited in terms of four stability properties (i.e., spatial, physical, format, and temporal), and new menu designs are introduced and discussed for both normal and small screens. The resulting set of graphical adaptive menu has been subject to a preference analysis from which a particular design emerged: the cloud menu, where predicted items are arranged in an adaptive tag cloud. We investigate empirically the effect of the cloud menu on the item selection time and the error rate with respect to a static menu and an adaptive linear menu. This article then suggests a set of usability guidelines for designers and practitioners to design graphical adaptive menus in general and cloud menus in particular.},

abstract = {Writing training systems have been developed to provide students with instruction and deliberate practice on their writing. Although generally successful in providing accurate scores, a common criticism of these systems is their lack of personalization and adaptive instruction. In particular, these systems tend to place the strongest emphasis on delivering accurate scores, and therefore, tend to overlook additional indices that may contribute to students' success, such as their affective states during writing practice. This study takes an initial step toward addressing this gap by building a predictive model of students' affect using information that can potentially be collected by computer systems. We used individual difference measures, text indices, and keystroke analyses to predict engagement and boredom in 132 writing sessions. The results suggest that these three categories of indices were successful in modeling students' affective states during writing. Taken together, indices related to students' academic abilities, text properties, and keystroke logs were able classify high and low engagement and boredom in writing sessions with accuracies between 76.5% and 77.3%. These results suggest that information readily available in writing training systems can inform affect detectors and ultimately improve student models within intelligent tutoring systems.},

abstract = {Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been used to enable efficient decision-making in managerial and organizational contexts, ranging from employment to dismissal. However, to avoid employees’ antipathy toward AI, it is important to understand what aspects of AI employees like and/or dislike. In this paper, we aim to identify how employees perceive current human resource (HR) teams and future algorithmic management. Specifically, we explored what factors negatively influence employees’ perceptions of AI making work performance evaluations. Through in-depth interviews with 21 workers, we found that 1) employees feel six types of burdens (i.e., emotional, mental, bias, manipulation, privacy, and social) toward AI's introduction to human resource management (HRM), and that 2) these burdens could be mitigated by incorporating transparency, interpretability, and human intervention to algorithmic decision-making. Based on our findings, we present design efforts to alleviate employees’ burdens. To leverage AI for HRM in fair and trustworthy ways, we call for the HCI community to design human-AI collaboration systems with various HR stakeholders.},

ASPLOS ’23 features 3 deadlines spaced throughout the year and papers will be published in three volumes. Multiple deadlines are meant to encourage authors to submit their papers when ready and to facilitate the selection of some papers for revision. For this volume of ASPLOS ’23, we discontinued the use of the 2-page extended abstract submissions that were used in ASPLOS ’21 and ASPLOS ’22. We found the extended abstract offered limited filtering and moved to a more traditional two phase review process. Each paper received 3 reviews in phase 1 and papers with positive scores advanced to the second round and received up to 2 more reviews. In our preface to Volume III, we will give a more detailed rundown of how the process worked.},

Studies have identified social and technical barriers to entry and discovered some potential solutions, but these solutions have typically focused on a single highly successful community, the English Wikipedia, been tested in isolation, and rarely evaluated through controlled experiments. We propose the Newcomer Homepage, a central place where newcomers can learn how peer production works and find opportunities to contribute, as a solution for attracting and retaining newcomers. The homepage was built upon existing research and designed in collaboration with partner communities. Through a large-scale controlled experiment spanning 27 non-English Wikipedia wikis, we evaluate the homepage and find modest gains, and that having a positive effect on the newcomer experience depends on the newcomer's context. We discuss how this impacts interventions that aim to improve the newcomer experience in peer production communities.},

This line of research, however, predominately focuses on positive leisure experiences, and it is unclear whether need fulfillment plays a similar role in negative experiences or in other activity domains such as work. Therefore, this study investigates need fulfillment in positive and negative experiences, and in work and leisure experiences in two separate studies by analyzing almost 600 users’ experiences with technology along with ratings on need fulfillment, affect, and perceived product quality. Results suggest that work and leisure experiences as well as positive and negative experiences differ in terms of need fulfillment. Hence, both activity domain and valence of experiences are important factors that should be taken in account when modeling user experience.},

abstract = {Lint is a widely-used static analyzer for detecting bugs/issues in Android apps. However, it can generate many false warnings. One existing solution to this problem is to leverage project history data (e.g., bug fixing statistics) for warning prioritization. Unfortunately, such techniques are biased toward a project’s archived warnings and can easily miss newissues. Anotherweakness is that developers cannot readily relate the warnings to the impacts perceivable by users. To overcome these weaknesses, in this paper, we propose a semantics-aware approach, OASIS, to prioritizing Lint warnings by leveraging app user reviews. OASIS combines program analysis and NLP techniques to recover the intrinsic links between the Lint warnings for a given app and the user complaints on the app problems caused by the issues of concern. OASIS leverages the strength of such links to prioritize warnings. We evaluated OASIS on six popular and large-scale open-source Android apps. The results show that OASIS can effectively prioritize Lint warnings and help identify new issues that are previously-unknown to app developers.},

In this paper, I identify the sociotechnical futures that Amazon-one of the big tech companies-envisions and the future of work that the company is moving toward. I explore the future of fulfillment centers through an analysis of the patents on fulfillment center technologies which Amazon may turn into reality one day. In my analysis, I focus on humans by asking how they are configured in the future of fulfillment centers and, more specifically, how Amazon envisions the role of human labor within work automation and AI systems. The analysis reveals where and how humans are expected to "step in" to operate the future of fulfillment centers. I discuss my findings within and beyond CSCW, highlighting the importance of studying tech companies' imaginaries. I argue that by understanding tech companies' imaginaries, it becomes possible for us to launch effective sociotechnical interventions to negotiate or even resist their specific imaginaries and/or design ways for a more democratic uptake of companies' future technologies. Finally, I articulate practical ways in which patents can be utilized in CSCW research.},

A widespread industry culture of 'move fast and break things,' however, has compelled data management practices that prioritize profit over preservation. This paper draws from archival theories of appraisal to foreground control, power, subjectivity, and emotion in computing practices that treat data storage as a neutral or objective cost-center. We draw on postmodern archival appraisal theory that recognizes the archive as a powerful and subjective curator of identity and memory. The theoretical basis of archival decision practices, in turn, establishes the value of the archival record and thus the need to save it. With three primary issues of appraisal theory as a framework, we report on an interview study with adults (N=17), ages 51-72, who are in a transitional life-stage that focuses them on their experiences and memories that are worth keeping or discarding. We sketch implications for data management paths that forefront legacy, life transitions, precarity, and control.},

In the process, developers may have negative interpersonal interactions with their peers, which can lead to frustration and stress; these negative interactions may ultimately result in developers abandoning projects. In this mixed-methods study at one company, we surveyed 1,317 developers to characterize the negative experiences and cross-referenced the results with objective data from code review logs to predict these experiences. Our results suggest that such negative experiences, which we call "pushback", are relatively rare in practice, but have negative repercussions when they occur. Our metrics can predict feelings of pushback with high recall but low precision, making them potentially appropriate for highlighting interactions that may benefit from a self-intervention.},

Public administrations pursue big data as “new oil” and implement data-centric policies to collect, generate, process, share, exploit, and protect data for promoting good governance, transparency, innovative digital services, and citizens’ engagement in public policy. All of the above constitute the Government Big Data Ecosystem (GBDE). Despite the great interest in this ecosystem, there is a lack of clear definitions, the various important types of government data remain vague, the different actors and their roles are not well defined, while the impact in key public administration sectors is not yet deeply understood and assessed. Such research and literature gaps impose a crucial obstacle for a better understanding of the prospects and nascent issues in exploiting GBDE. With this study, we aim to start filling the above-mentioned gaps by organizing our findings from an extended Systematic Literature Review into a framework to organise and address the above-mentioned challenges. Our goal is to contribute in this fast-evolving area by bringing some clarity and establishing common understanding around key elements of the emerging GBDE.},

abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a rapidly-growing transformative expansion of the Internet with increasing influence on our daily life. Since the number of "things" is expected to soon surpass human population, control and automation of IoT devices has received considerable attention from academia and industry. Cross-platform collaboration is highly desirable for better user experience due to fragmentation of user needs and vendor products with time. Centralized approaches have been used to build federated trust among platforms and devices, but limit diversity and scalability. We propose a decentralized trust framework, called IoT Passport, for cross-platform collaborations using blockchain technology. IoT Passport is motivated by the familiar use of passports for international travel but with greater dynamism. It enables platforms to establish arbitrary trust relations with each other containing specific rules for intended collaborations, enforced by a combination of smart contracts. Each interaction among devices is signed by the participants and recorded on the blockchain. The records are utilized as attributes for authorization and as proofs of incentive plans. This approach incorporates the preferences of participating platforms and end users, and opens new avenues for collaborative edge computing as well as research on blockchain-based access control mechanism for IoT environments.},

While the herculean task of evaluating hundreds of millions of websites can certainly benefit from the wisdom of crowds, skeptics question the coverage and reliability of inputs from ordinary users for assessing web security. We analyze the contribution patterns of serious and casual users in Web of Trust (WOT), a community-based system for website reputation and security. We find that the serious contributors are responsible for reporting and attending to a large percentage of bad sites, while a large fraction of attention on the goodness of sites come from the casual contributors. This complementarity enables WOT to provide warnings about malicious sites while differentiating the good sites from the unknowns. This in turn helps steer users away from the numerous bad sites created daily. We also find that serious contributors are more reliable in evaluating bad sites, but no better than casual contributors in evaluating good sites. We discuss design implications for WOT and for community-based systems more generally.},

abstract = {Deep learning has been increasingly adopted in many application areas. To construct valid deep learning models, developers must conform to certain computational constraints by carefully selecting appropriate neural architectures and hyperparameter values. For example, the kernel size hyperparameter of the 2D convolution operator cannot be overlarge to ensure that the height and width of the output tensor remain positive. Because model construction is largely manual and lacks necessary tooling support, it is possible to violate those constraints and raise type errors of deep learning models, causing either runtime exceptions or wrong output results. In this paper, we propose Refty, a refinement type-based tool for statically checking the validity of deep learning models ahead of job execution. Refty refines each type of deep learning operator with framework-independent logical formulae that describe the computational constraints on both tensors and hyperparameters. Given the neural architecture and hyperparameter domains of a model, Refty visits every operator, generates a set of constraints that the model should satisfy, and utilizes an SMT solver for solving the constraints. We have evaluated Refty on both individual operators and representative real-world models with various hyperparameter values under PyTorch and TensorFlow. We also compare it with an existing shape-checking tool. The experimental results show that Refty finds all the type errors and achieves 100% Precision and Recall, demonstrating its effectiveness.},

Our interviewees may have less computational skill in data work, but they have extensive and varied practices to engage in data contextualization that data scientists and other full community members could learn from. In identifying the attributes of data workers on the periphery, we also hope to call attention to the challenges they face in performing data work in low resources institutions (e.g., governmental, non-profit).

abstract = {Parsing the semantic structure of a web page is a key component of web information extraction. Successful extraction algorithms usually require large-scale training and evaluation datasets, which are difficult to acquire. Recently, crowdsourcing has proven to be an effective method of collecting large-scale training data in domains that do not require much domain knowledge. For more complex domains, researchers have proposed sophisticated quality control mechanisms to replicate tasks in parallel or sequential ways and then aggregate responses from multiple workers. Conventional annotation integration methods often put more trust in the workers with high historical performance; thus, they are called performance-based methods. Recently, Rzeszotarski and Kittur have demonstrated that behavioral features are also highly correlated with annotation quality in several crowdsourcing applications. In this article, we present a new crowdsourcing system, called Wernicke, to provide annotations for web information extraction. Wernicke collects a wide set of behavioral features and, based on these features, predicts annotation quality for a challenging task domain: annotating web page structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of quality control using behavioral features through a case study where 32 workers annotate 200 Q&amp;A web pages from five popular websites. In doing so, we discover several things: (1) Many behavioral features are significant predictors for crowdsourcing quality. (2) The behavioral-feature-based method outperforms performance-based methods in recall prediction, while performing equally with precision prediction. In addition, using behavioral features is less vulnerable to the cold-start problem, and the corresponding prediction model is more generalizable for predicting recall than precision for cross-website quality analysis. (3) One can effectively combine workers’ behavioral information and historical performance information to further reduce prediction errors.},

abstract = {As online document collections continue to expand, both on the Web and in proprietary environments, the need for duplicate detection becomes more critical. Few users wish to retrieve search results consisting of sets of duplicate documents, whether identical duplicates or close matches. Our goal in this work is to investigate the phenomenon and determine one or more approaches that minimize its impact on search results. Recent work has focused on using some form of signature to characterize a document in order to reduce the complexity of document comparisons. A representative technique constructs a 'fingerprint' of the rarest or richest features in a document using collection statistics as criteria for feature selection. One of the challenges of this approach, however, arises from the fact that in production environments, collections of documents are always changing, with new documents, or new versions of documents, arriving frequently, and other documents periodically removed. When an enterprise proceeds to freeze a training collection in order to stabilize the underlying repository of such features and its associated collection statistics, issues of coverage and completeness arise. We show that even with very large training collections possessing extremely high feature correlations before and after updates, underlying fingerprints remain sensitive to subtle changes. We explore alternative solutions that benefit from the development of massive meta-collections made up of sizable components from multiple domains. This technique appears to offer a practical foundation for fingerprint stability. We also consider mechanisms for updating training collections while mitigating signature instability. Our research is divided into three parts. We begin with a study of the distribution of duplicate types in two broad-ranging news collections consisting of approximately 50 million documents. We then examine the utility of document signatures in addressing identical or nearly identical duplicate documents and their sensitivity to collection updates. Finally, we investigate a flexible method of characterizing and comparing documents in order to permit the identification of non-identical duplicates. This method has produced promising results following an extensive evaluation using a production-based test collection created by domain experts.},

abstract = {As the most widely used parallel job scheduling strategy in production schedulers, EASY has achieved great success, not only because it can balance fairness and performance, but also because it is universally applicable to most HPC systems. However, unfairness still exists in EASY. For real workloads used in this work, our simulation shows that a blocked job can be delayed by later jobs for more than 90 hours. In addition, EASY cannot directly employ parallel job runtime prediction techniques, because this would lead to a serious situation called reservation violation.In this paper, we aim at guaranteeing strict fairness (no job is delayed by any jobs of lower priority) while achieving attractive performance, and employing prediction without causing reservation violation in parallel job scheduling. We propose two novel strategies, shadow load preemption (SLP) and venture backfilling (VB), which are together integrated into EASY to construct a preemptive venture EASY backfilling (PV-EASY) strategy. Experimental results on three workloads of real HPC systems demonstrate that: First, PV-EASY guarantees strict fairness, in addition to avoiding reservation violation when employing job runtime prediction techniques in scheduling; Second, PV-EASY achieves the same performance as EASY, and outperforms prediction employed EASY; Third, the preemption in PV-EASY is not resource costly and simple enough to be implemented in all HPC systems where EASY works. These advantages make PV-EASY more attractive than EASY in parallel job scheduling, both from academic and industry perspectives.},

abstract = {Devices with embedded sensors are permeating the computing landscape, allowing the collection and analysis of rich data about individuals, smart spaces, and their interactions. This class of devices enables a useful array of home automation and connected workplace functionality to individuals within instrumented spaces. Unfortunately, the increasing pervasiveness of sensors can lead to perceptions of privacy loss by their occupants. Given that many instrumented spaces exist as platforms outside of a user's control---e.g., IoT sensors in the home that rely on cloud infrastructure or connected workplaces managed by one's employer---enforcing access controls via a trusted reference monitor may do little to assuage individuals' privacy concerns. This calls for novel enforcement mechanisms for controlling access to sensed data. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between sensor fidelity and individual comfort, with the goal of understanding the design space for effective, yet palatable, sensors for the workplace. In the context of a common space contextualization task, we survey and interview individuals about their comfort with three common sensing modalities: video, audio, and passive infrared. This allows us to explore the extent to which discomfort with sensor platforms is a function of detected states or sensed data. Our findings uncover interesting interplays between content, context, fidelity, history, and privacy. This, in turn, leads to design recommendations regarding how to increase comfort with sensing technologies by revisiting the mechanisms by which user preferences and policies are enforced in situations where the infrastructure itself is not trusted.},

abstract = {Regular expressions (regexes) are a powerful mechanism for solving string-matching problems. They are supported by all modern programming languages, and have been estimated to appear in more than a third of Python and JavaScript projects. Yet existing studies have focused mostly on one aspect of regex programming: readability. We know little about how developers perceive and program regexes, nor the difficulties that they face.In this paper, we provide the first study of the regex development cycle, with a focus on (1) how developers make decisions throughout the process, (2) what difficulties they face, and (3) how aware they are about serious risks involved in programming regexes. We took a mixed-methods approach, surveying 279 professional developers from a diversity of backgrounds (including top tech firms) for a high-level perspective, and interviewing 17 developers to learn the details about the difficulties that they face and the solutions that they prefer.In brief, regexes are hard. Not only are they hard to read, our participants said that they are hard to search for, hard to validate, and hard to document. They are also hard to master: the majority of our studied developers were unaware of critical security risks that can occur when using regexes, and those who knew of the risks did not deal with them in effective manners. Our findings provide multiple implications for future work, including semantic regex search engines for regex reuse and improved input generators for regex validation.},

abstract = {Governance in online communities is an increasingly high-stakes challenge, and yet many basic features of offline governance legacies-juries, political parties, term limits, and formal debates, to name a few-are not in the feature-sets of the software most community platforms use. Drawing on the paradigm of Institutional Analysis and Development, this paper proposes a strategy for addressing this lapse by specifying basic features of a generalizable paradigm for online governance called Modular Politics. Whereas classical governance typologies tend to present a choice among wholesale ideologies, such as democracy or oligarchy, Modular Politics would enable platform operators and their users to build bottom-up governance processes from computational components that are modular and composable, highly versatile in their expressiveness, portable from one context to another, and interoperable across platforms. This kind of approach could implement pre-digital governance systems as well as accelerate innovation in uniquely digital techniques. As diverse communities share and connect their components and data, governance could occur through a ubiquitous network layer. To that end, this paper proposes the development of an open standard for networked governance.},

abstract = {An emergency like COVID-19 requires a theoretical framework for policy implementation that involves public and private sector collaborations. After policy failures, new institutions have formed that trigger PPP's later, allowing the incumbent administration to continue in office longer. It focuses on novel approaches to dealing with pandemics. The present administration put these rules in place to keep COVID-19 under control. When it comes to Real Time - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, South Korea's government and corporations partnered to swiftly raise the quantity of testing in the country. Models of policy change are shown to be dynamic, cyclical, and recursive. During the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea, an empirical content research was conducted. Even though South Korea's leader was at risk of losing public support to the point where impeachment was mentioned as a possible option, he dramatically reversed public mood to win general elections by a wide margin in April 2020, while the pandemic scenario persisted. To win reelection, democratic administrations are under more pressure to effectively perform crisis management when faced with a crisis. As a result, they are under even more pressure to immediately mobilize public and private resources. The emergency use authorization (EUA) protocol for test kits is an example of "leapfrogging actors" – up-and-coming innovators – who helped turn a pandemic tragedy into a possibility for sustained leadership and for them.

abstract = {Voice assistants have become hugely popular in the home as domestic and entertainment devices. Recently, there has been a move towards developing them for work settings. For example, Alexa for Business and IBM Watson for Business were designed to improve productivity, by assisting with various tasks, such as scheduling meetings and taking minutes. However, this kind of assistance is largely limited to planning and managing user's work. How might they be developed to do more by way of empowering people at work? Our research is concerned with achieving this by developing an agent with the role of a facilitator that assists users during an ongoing task. Specifically, we were interested in whether the modality in which the agent interacts with users makes a difference: How does a voice versus screen-based agent interaction affect user behavior? We hypothesized that voice would be more immediate and emotive, resulting in more fluid conversations and interactions. Here, we describe a user study that compared the benefits of using voice versus screen-based interactions when interacting with a system incorporating an agent, involving pairs of participants doing an exploratory data analysis task that required them to make sense of a series of data visualizations. The findings from the study show marked differences between the two conditions, with voice resulting in more turn-taking in discussions, questions asked, more interactions with the system and a tendency towards more immediate, faster-paced discussions following agent prompts. We discuss the possible reasons for why talking and being prompted by a voice assistant may be preferable and more effective at mediating human-human conversations and we translate some of the key insights of this research into design implications.},

abstract = {Decision-making is a key software engineering skill. Developers constantly make choices throughout the software development process, from requirements to implementation. While prior work has studied developer decision-making, the choices made while choosing what solution to write in code remain understudied. In this mixed-methods study, we examine the phenomenon where developers select one specific way to implement a behavior in code, given many potential alternatives. We call these decisions implementation design decisions. Our mixed-methods study includes 46 survey responses and 14 semi-structured interviews with professional developers about their decision types, considerations, processes, and expertise for implementation design decisions. We find that implementation design decisions, rather than being a natural outcome from higher levels of design, require constant monitoring of higher level design choices, such as requirements and architecture. We also show that developers have a consistent general structure to their implementation decision-making process, but no single process is exactly the same. We discuss the implications of our findings on research, education, and practice, including insights on teaching developers how to make implementation design decisions.},

Still, how different disabilities can interact in a mixed-ability team is underexplored, especially for long commitments and in non-western contexts. As an emerging perspective in accessibility studies in HCI, disability justice emphasizes the importance of cross-disability collaborations. Collaborative access, interdependence, and cross-disability dialogue are keys to building accessible mixed-ability interactions. We conducted ten in-depth interviews with the members of a unique mixed-ability team (which includes people with different physical disabilities) using the same workspace with cross-disability interactions in Turkey. We aim to understand the requirements for an accessible mixed-ability virtual workspace and to identify practical design considerations for cross-disability solidarity-oriented virtual collaboration tools. To ensure equal access in virtual workspaces, we suggest implications for centering collective access, balancing external power dynamics, and supporting language and cultural diversities.},

abstract = {Social media users may wish to delete their accounts, but it is unclear if this process is easy to complete or if users understand what happens to their account data after deletion. Furthermore, since platforms profit from users' data and activity, they have incentives to maintain active users, possibly affecting what account deletion options are offered. To investigate these issues, we conducted a two-part study. In Study Part 1, we created and deleted accounts on the top 20 social media platforms in the United States and performed an analysis of 490 deletion-related screens across these platforms. In Study Part 2, informed by our interface analysis, we surveyed 200 social media users to understand how users perceive and experience social media account deletion. From these studies, we have four main findings. First, account deletion options vary considerably across platforms and the language used to describe these options is not always clear. Most platforms offer account deletion on desktop browsers but not all allow account deletion from mobile apps or browsers. Second, we found evidence of several dark patterns present in the account deletion interfaces and platform policies. Third, most participants had tried to delete at least one social media account, yet over one-third of deletion attempts were never completed. Fourth, users mostly agreed that they did not want platforms to have access to deleted account data. Based on these results, we recommend that platforms improve the terminology used in account deletion interfaces so the outcomes of account deletion are more clear to users. Additionally, we recommend that platforms allow users to delete their social media accounts from any device they use to access the platform. Finally, future work is needed to assess how users are affected by account deletion related dark patterns.},

This manuscript provides a characterization of the application of gamification to the Software Testing area. Such practice in fact reportedly suffers from low engagement by both personnel in industrial contexts and learners in educational contexts. Our goal is to identify the application areas and utilized gamified techniques and mechanics, the provided benefits and drawbacks, as well as the open challenges in the field. To this purpose, we conducted a Multivocal Literature Review to identify white and grey literature sources addressing gamified software testing.We analyzed 73 contributions and summarized the most common gamified mechanics, concepts, tools, and domains where they are mostly applied. We conclude that gamification in software testing is mostly applied to the test creation phase with simple white-box unit or mutation testing tools and is mostly used to foster good behaviors by promoting the testers’ accomplishment. Key research areas and main challenges in the field are: careful design of tailored gamified mechanics for specific testing techniques; the need for technological improvements to enable crowdsourcing, cooperation, and concurrency; the necessity for empirical and large-scale evaluation of the benefits delivered by gamification mechanics.},

abstract = {The workplace has experienced extensive digital transformation, in part due to artificial intelligence's commercial availability. Though still an emerging technology, emotional artificial intelligence (EAI) is increasingly incorporated into enterprise systems to augment and automate organizational decisions and to monitor and manage workers. EAI use is often celebrated for its potential to improve workers' wellbeing and performance as well as address organizational problems such as bias and safety. Workers subject to EAI in the workplace are data subjects whose data make EAI possible and who are most impacted by it. However, we lack empirical knowledge about data subjects' perspectives on EAI, including in the workplace. To this end, using a relational ethics lens, we qualitatively analyzed 395 U.S. adults' open-ended survey (partly representative) responses regarding the perceived benefits and risks they associate with being subjected to EAI in the workplace. While participants acknowledged potential benefits of being subject to EAI (e.g., employers using EAI to aid their wellbeing, enhance their work environment, reduce bias), a myriad of potential risks overshadowed perceptions of potential benefits. Participants expressed concerns regarding the potential for EAI use to harm their wellbeing, work environment and employment status, and create and amplify bias and stigma against them, especially the most marginalized (e.g., along dimensions of race, gender, mental health status, disability). Distrustful of EAI and its potential risks, participants anticipated conforming to (e.g., partaking in emotional labor) or refusing (e.g., quitting a job) EAI implementation in practice. We argue that EAI may magnify, rather than alleviate, existing challenges data subjects face in the workplace and suggest that some EAI-inflicted harms would persist even if concerns of EAI's accuracy and bias are addressed.},

abstract = {Concretely communicating technical debt and its consequences is of common interest to both researchers and software engineers. In the absence of validated tools and techniques to achieve this goal with repeatable results, developers resort to ad hoc practices. Most commonly they report using issue trackers or their existing backlog management practices to capture and track technical debt. In a manual examination of 1,264 issues from four issue trackers from open source industry and government projects, we identified 109 examples of technical debt. Our study reveals that technical debt and its related concepts have entered the vernacular of developers as they discuss development tasks through issue trackers. Even when issues are not explicitly tagged as technical debt, it is possible to identify technical debt items in these issue trackers using a categorization method we developed. We use our results and data to motivate an improved definition and an approach to explicitly report technical debt in issue trackers.},

abstract = {Engaging local communities is essential to safeguarding intangible cultural heritage (ICH). To better encourage the participation of local communities, especially younger generations, e.g., students, ICH experience and education workshops are widely adopted by academia, museums, governments, and non-profit organizations. The expected outcomes of these workshops, such as archives, documents, and even creative design solutions, can benefit the promotion and preservation of ICH. However, because of the steep learning curve of using traditional ICH tools and the lack of interactions between students and ICH practitioners, many ICH workshops currently fail to engage students in learning ICH-related knowledge, developing empathy with ICH, or designing novel artifacts with ICH elements. To bridge this gap, we designed a workshop, which integrated ICH in China, digital fabrication, creative technology, and making, to engage Chinese students with ICH and creative design. We conducted empirical studies to collect feedback from students (N = 30) and ICH professionals (N=6). The application of digital fabrication tools successfully piqued students’ interest in ICH and enabled them to create interactive ICH artifacts through quick prototyping. However, the ICH professionals pointed out several issues of using digital fabrication, especially regarding tacit knowledge, use of traditional tools, and cultural authenticity. We discuss the importance of these factors in students’ acquisition of ICH knowledge and ICH-oriented design, and provide implications for future ICH design workshops.},

abstract = {Today, industry practitioners (e.g., data scientists, developers, product managers) rely on formal privacy reviews (a combination of user interviews, privacy risk assessments, etc.) in identifying potential customer acceptance issues with their organization’s data practices. However, this process is slow and expensive, and practitioners often have to make ad-hoc privacy-related decisions with little actual feedback from users. We introduce Lean Privacy Review (LPR), a fast, cheap, and easy-to-access method to help practitioners collect direct feedback from users through the proxy of crowd workers in the early stages of design. LPR takes a proposed data practice, quickly breaks it down into smaller parts, generates a set of questionnaire surveys, solicits users’ opinions, and summarizes those opinions in a compact form for practitioners to use. By doing so, LPR can help uncover the range and magnitude of different privacy concerns actual people have at a small fraction of the cost and wait-time for a formal review. We evaluated LPR using 12 real-world data practices with 240 crowd users and 24 data practitioners. Our results show that (1) the discovery of privacy concerns saturates as the number of evaluators exceeds 14 participants, which takes around 5.5 hours to complete (i.e., latency) and costs 3.7 hours of total crowd work ( $80 in our experiments); and (2) LPR finds 89% of privacy concerns identified by data practitioners as well as 139% additional privacy concerns that practitioners are not aware of, at a 6% estimated false alarm rate.},

abstract = {The online technical Q&amp;A site Stack Overflow (SO) is popular among developers to support their coding and diverse development needs. To address shortcomings in API official documentation resources, several research works have thus focused on augmenting official API documentation with insights (e.g., code examples) from SO. The techniques propose to add code examples/insights about APIs into its official documentation. Recently, surveys of software developers find that developers in SO consider the combination of code examples and reviews about APIs as a form of API documentation, and that they consider such a combination to be more useful than official API documentation when the official resources can be incomplete, ambiguous, incorrect, and outdated. Reviews are opinionated sentences with positive/negative sentiments. However, we are aware of no previous research that attempts to automatically produce API documentation from SO by considering both API code examples and reviews. In this article, we present two novel algorithms that can be used to automatically produce API documentation from SO by combining code examples and reviews towards those examples. The first algorithm is called statistical documentation, which shows the distribution of positivity and negativity around the code examples of an API using different metrics (e.g., star ratings). The second algorithm is called concept-based documentation, which clusters similar and conceptually relevant usage scenarios. An API usage scenario contains a code example, a textual description of the underlying task addressed by the code example, and the reviews (i.e., opinions with positive and negative sentiments) from other developers towards the code example. We deployed the algorithms in Opiner, a web-based platform to aggregate information about APIs from online forums. We evaluated the algorithms by mining all Java JSON-based posts in SO and by conducting three user studies based on produced documentation from the posts. The first study is a survey, where we asked the participants to compare our proposed algorithms against a Javadoc-syle documentation format (called as Type-based documentation in Opiner). The participants were asked to compare along four development scenarios (e.g., selection, documentation). The participants preferred our proposed two algorithms over type-based documentation. In our second user study, we asked the participants to complete four coding tasks using Opiner and the API official and informal documentation resources. The participants were more effective and accurate while using Opiner. In a subsequent survey, more than 80% of participants asked the Opiner documentation platform to be integrated into the formal API documentation to complement and improve the API official documentation.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow has been heavily used by software developers to seek programming-related information. More and more developers use Community Question and Answer forums, such as Stack Overflow, to search for code examples of how to accomplish a certain coding task. This is often considered to be more efficient than working from source documentation, tutorials, or full worked examples. However, due to the complexity of these online Question and Answer forums and the very large volume of information they contain, developers can be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of available information. This makes it hard to find and/or even be aware of the most relevant code examples to meet their needs. To alleviate this issue, in this work, we present a query-driven code recommendation tool, named Que2Code, that identifies the best code snippets for a user query from Stack Overflow posts. Our approach has two main stages: (i) semantically equivalent question retrieval and (ii) best code snippet recommendation. During the first stage, for a given query question formulated by a developer, we first generate paraphrase questions for the input query as a way of query boosting and then retrieve the relevant Stack Overflow posted questions based on these generated questions. In the second stage, we collect all of the code snippets within questions retrieved in the first stage and develop a novel scheme to rank code snippet candidates from Stack Overflow posts via pairwise comparisons. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we conduct a large-scale experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the semantically equivalent question retrieval task and best code snippet recommendation task separately on Python and Java datasets in Stack Overflow. We also perform a human study to measure how real-world developers perceive the results generated by our model. Both the automatic and human evaluation results demonstrate the promising performance of our model, and we have released our code and data to assist other researchers.},

We investigated the contextual factors that influence young adults’ day-to-day experiences when interacting with such tools. Through interviews and focus group discussions with 36 participants, we identified that people’s daily schedules and affective states were dominant factors that shape their messaging preferences. We developed two messaging dialogues centered around these factors, which we deployed to 42 participants to test and extend our initial understanding of users’ needs. Across both studies, participants provided diverse opinions of how they could be best supported by messages, particularly around when to engage users in more passive versus active ways. They also proposed ways of adjusting message length and content during periods of low mood. Our findings provide design implications and opportunities for context-aware mental health management systems.},

abstract = {Programmers who work with smart contract development often encounter challenges in reusing code from repositories. This is due to the presence of two unknowns that can lead to non-functional and functional failures. These unknowns are implicit collaborations between functions and subtle differences among similar functions. Current code mining methods can extract syntax and semantic knowledge (known knowledge), but they cannot uncover these unknowns due to a significant gap between the known and the unknown. To address this issue, we formulate knowledge acquisition as a knowledge deduction task and propose an analytic flow that uses the function clone as a bridge to gradually deduce the known knowledge into the problem-solving knowledge that can reveal the unknowns. This flow comprises five methods: clone detection, co-occurrence probability calculation, function usage frequency accumulation, description propagation, and control flow graph annotation. This provides a systematic and coherent approach to knowledge deduction. We then structure all of the knowledge into a semantic-enriched code Knowledge Graph (KG) and integrate this KG into two software engineering tasks: code recommendation and crowd-scaled coding practice checking. As a proof of concept, we apply our approach to 5,140 smart contract files available on Etherscan.io and confirm high accuracy of our KG construction steps. In our experiments, our code KG effectively improved code recommendation accuracy by 6% to 45%, increased diversity by 61% to 102%, and enhanced NDCG by 1% to 21%. Furthermore, compared to traditional analysis tools and the debugging-with-the-crowd method, our KG improved time efficiency by 30 to 380 seconds, vulnerability determination accuracy by 20% to 33%, and vulnerability fixing accuracy by 24% to 40% for novice developers who identified and fixed vulnerable smart contract functions.},

abstract = {Sir Tony Hoare has had an enormous influence on computer science, from the Quicksort algorithm to the science of software development, concurrency and program verification. His contributions have been widely recognised: He was awarded the ACM’s Turing Award in 1980, the Kyoto Prize from the Inamori Foundation in 2000, and was knighted for “services to education and computer science” by Queen Elizabeth II of England in 2000.This book presents the essence of his various works—the quest for effective abstractions—both in his own words as well as chapters written by leading experts in the field, including many of his research collaborators. In addition, this volume contains biographical material, his Turing award lecture, the transcript of an interview and some of his seminal papers.Hoare’s foundational paper “An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming”, presented his approach, commonly known as Hoare Logic, for proving the correctness of programs by using logical assertions. Hoare Logic and subsequent developments have formed the basis of a wide variety of software verification efforts. Hoare was instrumental in proposing the Verified Software Initiative, a cooperative international project directed at the scientific challenges of large-scale software verification, encompassing theories, tools and experiments.Tony Hoare’s contributions to the theory and practice of concurrent software systems are equally impressive. The process algebra called Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) has been one of the fundamental paradigms, both as a mathematical theory to reason about concurrent computation as well as the basis for the programming language occam. CSP served as a framework for exploring several ideas in denotational semantics such as powerdomains, as well as notions of abstraction and refinement. It is the basis for a series of industrial-strength tools which have been employed in a wide range of applications.This book also presents Hoare’s work in the last few decades. These works include a rigorous approach to specifications in software engineering practice, including procedural and data abstractions, data refinement, and a modular theory of designs. More recently, he has worked with collaborators to develop Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP). Their goal is to identify the common algebraic theories that lie at the core of sequential, concurrent, reactive and cyber-physical computations. Theories of Programming: The Life and Works of Tony Hoare’ is available as a printed book (DOI: ) and an on-line version.

A generalized set of guidelines for the design of HMI is also proposed to address these challenges and thereby enable effective and intuitive diagnostics and error corrections when process failures occur. These guidelines are aimed at aiding researchers in developing effective interface and interaction technologies, maximizing operator situation awareness in human-robot collaborative manufacturing teams, promoting effective process and system diagnostics reporting, and enabling faster responses to equipment or application errors.},

abstract = {Students have experienced incredible shifts in their learning environments, brought about by the response of universities to the ever-changing public health mandates driven by waves and stages of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Initially, these shifts in learning (mode of course delivery, course availability, etc.) were considered emergency responses. However, as the pandemic pressed on, students have had to repeatedly adapt to the continuously evolving educational landscape. This working group builds upon foundations and structure created by a 2021 ITiCSE Working Group exploring the effects of COVID-19 on teaching and learning from a faculty perspective. That working group identified the incorporation of some pandemic-induced changes into future teaching practices. This working group examines the existing literature and insights gained from responses to a multi-national survey to explore the new student experience emerging from the continuously evolving teaching practices catalyzed by the global pandemic. Traditionally, computing is a subject full of experiential learning opportunities, rich with in-person labs and exercises. We investigate how the changes within the COVID-affected academic landscape have altered that student experience. The current group of computing students will have had experiences under both typical (i.e. pre-pandemic) and COVID-affected teaching practices. It is, therefore, timely that we understand how each has impacted how they perceive their learning environment and educational experience. In turn, identifying those practices that have most benefited the student learning experience will help computing faculty improve their educational methods going forward.},

A marginalized perspective in these conversations is that of data subjects potentially affected by emotion recognition. Taking social media as one emotion recognition deployment context, we conducted interviews with data subjects (i.e., social media users) to investigate their notions about accuracy and transparency in emotion recognition and interrogate stated attitudes towards these notions and related folk theories. We find that data subjects see accurate inferences as uncomfortable and as threatening their agency, pointing to privacy and ambiguity as desired design principles for social media platforms. While some participants argued that contemporary emotion recognition must be accurate, others raised concerns about possibilities for contesting the technology and called for better transparency. Furthermore, some challenged the technology altogether, highlighting that emotions are complex, relational, performative, and situated. In interpreting our findings, we identify new folk theories about accuracy and meaningful transparency in emotion recognition. Overall, our analysis shows an unsatisfactory status quo for data subjects that is shaped by power imbalances and a lack of reflexivity and democratic deliberation within platform governance.},

abstract = {Modern window-based user interface systems generate user interface events as natural products of their normal operation. Because such events can be automatically captured and because they indicate user behavior with respect to an application's user interface, they have long been regarded as a potentially fruitful source of information regarding application usage and usability. However, because user interface events are typically voluminos and rich in detail, automated support is generally required to extract information at a level of abstraction that is useful to investigators interested in analyzing application usage or evaluating usability. This survey examines computer-aided techniques used by HCI practitioners and researchers to extract usability-related information from user interface events. A framework is presented to help HCI practitioners and researchers categorize and compare the approaches that have been, or might fruitfully be, applied to this problem. Because many of the techniques in the research literature have not been evaluated in practice, this survey provides a conceptual evaluation to help identify some of the relative merits and drawbacks of the various classes of approaches. Ideas for future research in this area are also presented. This survey addresses the following questions: How might user interface events be used in evaluating usability? How are user interface events related to other forms of usability data? What are the key challenges faced by investigators wishing to exploit this data? What approaches have been brought to bear on this problem and how do they compare to one another? What are some of the important open research questions in this area?},

Code review discussions among developers and maintainers can be heated and sometimes involve personal attacks and unnecessary disrespectful comments, demonstrating, therefore, incivility. Although incivility in public discussions has received increasing attention from researchers in different domains, the knowledge about the characteristics, causes, and consequences of uncivil communication is still very limited in the context of software development, and more specifically, code review. To address this gap in the literature, we leverage the mature social construct of incivility as a lens to understand confrontational conflicts in open source code review discussions. For that, we conducted a qualitative analysis on 1,545 emails from the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML) that were associated with rejected changes. We found that more than half (66.66%) of the non-technical emails included uncivil features. Particularly, frustration, name calling, and impatience are the most frequent features in uncivil emails. We also found that there are civil alternatives to address arguments, while uncivil comments can potentially be made by any people when discussing any topic. Finally, we identified various causes and consequences of such uncivil communication. Our work serves as the first study about the phenomenon of in(civility) in open source software development, paving the road for a new field of research about collaboration and communication in the context of software engineering activities.},

abstract = {Micro patterns are similar to design patterns, except that micro patterns are stand at a lower, closer to the implementation, level of abstraction. Micro patterns are also unique in that they are mechanically recognizable, since each such pattern can be expressed as a formal condition on the structure of a class.This paper presents a catalog of 27 micro-patterns defined on Java classes and interfaces. The catalog captures a wide spectrum of common programming practices, including a particular and (intentionally restricted) use of inheritance, immutability, data management and wrapping, restricted creation, and emulation of procedural-, modular-, and even functional- programming paradigms with object oriented constructs. Together, the patterns present a set of prototypes after which a large portion of all Java classes and interfaces are modeled. We provide empirical indication that this portion is as high as 75%.A statistical analysis of occurrences of micro patterns in a large software corpus, spanning some 70,000 Java classes drawn from a rich set of application domains, shows, with high confidence level that the use of these patterns is not random. These results indicate consciousness and discernible design decisions, which are sustained in the software evolution. With high confidence level, we can also show that the use of these patterns is tied to the specification, or the purpose, that the software realizes.The traceability, abundance and the statistical significance of micro pattern occurrence raise the hope of using the classification of software into these patterns for a more founded appreciation of its design and code quality.},

While this research has explored data protection shortcomings for users, UX is a designed encounter reconciling development, economic, compliance and strategic business priorities. And so, in addition to studying user perspectives, there is a gap in understanding how designers and business leaders influence the UX of data protection. To address this gap, we study smart home users, designers and business leaders, exploring how they experience data protection interactions, regulation, and processes. Our findings confirm that users have poor data protection interactions (e.g., consent and data access requests). We also find that business leaders and designers experience difficulties in identifying, applying, and tailoring suitable processes and practices for data protection for which some have developed "discount data protection": shortcuts, heuristics, and common sense practices to overcome these challenges.},

While there is a large body of research on different problems and methods for social network mining, there is a gap between the techniques developed by the research community and their deployment in real-world applications. Therefore the potential business impact of these techniques is still largely unexplored.In this article we use a business process classification framework to put the research topics in a business context and provide an overview of what we consider key problems and techniques in social network analysis and mining from the perspective of business applications. In particular, we discuss data acquisition and preparation, trust, expertise, community structure, network dynamics, and information propagation. In each case we present a brief overview of the problem, describe state-of-the art approaches, discuss business application examples, and map each of the topics to a business process classification framework. In addition, we provide insights on prospective business applications, challenges, and future research directions. The main contribution of this article is to provide a state-of-the-art overview of current techniques while providing a critical perspective on business applications of social network analysis and mining.},

abstract = {Critical decisions among design altern seventh atives with regards to maintainability arise early in the software design cycle. Existing comparison models relayed on the structural evolution of the used design patterns are suitable to support such decisions. However, their effectiveness on predicting maintenance effort is usually verified on a limited number of case studies under heterogeneous metrics. In this article, a multi-variable simulation model for validating the decision-making reliability of the derived formal comparison models for the significant designing problem of recursive hierarchies of part-whole aggregations, proposed in our prior work, is introduced. In the absence of a strict validation, the simulation model has been thoroughly calibrated concerning its decision-making precision based on empirical distributions from time-series analysis, approximating the highly uncertain nature of actual maintenance process. The decision reliability of the formal models has been statistically validated on a sample of 1,000 instances of design attributes representing the entire design space of the problem. Despite the limited accuracy of measurements, the results show that the models demonstrate an increasing reliability in a long-term perspective, even under assumptions of high variability. Thus, the modeling theory discussed in our prior work delivers reliable models that significantly reduce decision-risk and relevant maintenance cost.},

abstract = {The concurrent think-aloud protocol—in which participants verbalize their thoughts when performing tasks—is a widely employed approach in usability testing. Despite its value, analyzing think-aloud sessions can be onerous because it often entails assessing all of a user's verbalizations. This has motivated previous research on developing categories to segment verbalizations into manageable units of analysis. However, the way in which a category might relate to usability problems is currently unclear. In this research, we sought to address this gap in our understanding. We also studied how speech features might relate to usability problems. Through two studies, this research demonstrates that certain patterns of verbalizations are more telling of usability problems than others and that these patterns are robust to different types of test products (i.e., physical devices and digital systems), access to different types of information (i.e., video and audio modality), and the presence or absence of a visualization of verbalizations. The implication is that the verbalization and speech patterns can potentially reduce the time and effort required for analysis by enabling evaluators to focus more on the important aspects of a user's verbalizations. The patterns could also potentially be used to inform the design of systems to automatically detect when in the recorded think-aloud sessions users experience problems.},

abstract = {Widespread personalized computing systems play an already important and fast-growing role in diverse contexts, such as location-based services, recommenders, commercial Web-based services, and teaching systems. The personalization in these systems is driven by information about the user, a user model. Moreover, as computers become both ubiquitous and pervasive, personalization operates across the many devices and information stores that constitute the user's personal digital ecosystem. This enables personalization, and the user models driving it, to play an increasing role in people's everyday lives. This makes it critical to establish ways to address key problems of personalization related to privacy, invisibility of personalization, errors in user models, wasted user models, and the broad issue of enabling people to control their user models and associated personalization. We offer scrutable user models as a foundation for tackling these problems.This article argues the importance of scrutable user modeling and personalization, illustrating key elements in case studies from our work. We then identify the broad roles for scrutable user models. The article describes how to tackle the technical and interface challenges of designing and building scrutable user modeling systems, presenting design principles and showing how they were established over our twenty years of work on the Personis software framework. Our contributions are the set of principles for scrutable personalization linked to our experience from creating and evaluating frameworks and associated applications built upon them. These constitute a general approach to tackling problems of personalization by enabling users to scrutinize their user models as a basis for understanding and controlling personalization.},

abstract = {Model comparison has been widely used to support many tasks in model-driven software development. For this reason, many techniques of comparing them have been proposed in the last few decades. However, academia and industry have overlooked a classification of currently available approaches to the comparison of design models. Hence, a thorough understanding of state-of-the-art techniques remains limited and inconclusive. This article, therefore, focuses on providing a classification and a thematic analysis of studies on the comparison of software design models. We carried out a systematic mapping study following well-established guidelines to answer nine research questions. In total, 56 primary studies (out of 4,132) were selected from 10 widely recognized electronic databases after a careful filtering process. The main results are that a majority of the primary studies (1) provide coarse-grained techniques of the comparison of general-purpose diagrams, (2) adopt graphs as principal data structure and compare software design models considering structural properties only, (3) pinpoint commonalities and differences between software design models rather than assess their similarity, and (4) propose new techniques while neglecting the production of empirical knowledge from experimental studies. Finally, this article highlights some challenges and directions that can be explored in upcoming studies.},

abstract = {Welcome to ITiCSE 2015 in Vilnius!The ITiCSE conference celebrates its 20th anniversary in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania and the geographical center of Europe, so declared in 1989 by scientists of the French National Institute of Geography.ITiCSE will be held on July 6--8, starting on Lithuania's Statehood Day (July 6). This is an annual public holiday that commemorates the coronation in 1253 of Mindaugas as the first and only King of Lithuania. The conference venue is the Parliament buildings (Seimas) of the Republic of Lithuania, and the conference dinner is to served in the reconstructed Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, one of the most famous in Europe in the 15--17th centuries. ITiCSE 2015 is hosted by Vilnius University, one of the oldest and most famous establishments of higher education in Eastern and Central Europe, founded in 1579. The conference organizers represent the Lithuanian research group of Informatics and Informatics Engineering Didactics at the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics of Vilnius University.This conference brings together delegates from all over the world to address pressing issues in computing education. In addition to invited lectures, papers, panels, posters, and tips, techniques &amp; courseware sessions, the conference provides facilities and exposure for working groups and exhibitions.The conference continues to be truly international with a total of 170 submissions from 40 countries on six continents, with authors from Africa (4), Asia (50), Europe (151), North America (119), Oceania (51), and South America (17). These submissions consisted of 124 research papers, 1 panel, 9 working group proposals, and 36 proposals for posters or for tips, techniques &amp; courseware.All research papers were double blind reviewed by at least four reviewers, though most papers received five or six reviews. A meta-review was conducted by the members of the conference committee to ensure the reliability of the reviews and to make recommendations to the chairs. A final selection phase was conducted by the program chairs who reviewed all reviews and meta-review recommendations before making their final decisions. As a result of this process, 54 research papers (43.5%) were selected for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. The authors of the accepted papers come from 17 different countries on five continents.All poster submissions were blind reviewed by two members of the conference committee, and tips, techniques &amp; courseware submissions were blind reviewed by three members of the conference committee. Submissions in these categories were then reviewed by the conference chair before selection by the program chairs for final inclusion in the conference. Twenty-four were accepted, representing authors from 15 countries.The two keynote speakers address the learning of programming and computational thinking. Professor Mordechai (Moti) Ben-Ari from the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, will give a talk titled In Defense of Programming, which defends the (perhaps controversial) position that programming is the fundamental activity of CS. In the other keynote talk Professor Maciej M. Syslo from Nicolaus Copernicus University and University of Wroc\l{}aw, Poland, will address algorithmic nand computational thinking as the way to computing for all students.ITiCSE is famous for its working groups. Participating in a working group provides a unique opportunity to work with people from different countries who are interested and knowledgeable in the area of the working group. It is also one of the best ways to become part of the ITiCSE community. Seven working groups have been accepted over a broad spectrum of topics. The working groups range from general topics, such as computing education terminology, CS education in K-9 and K-12 schools, and designing an IT curriculum framework for graduates in 2025, to more specific topics such as developing a repository for high school CS questions, visual assessment tools and metadata annotations, and how students construct solutions to programming problems. The leaders of the accepted working groups come from over 13 countries.Welcome to Vilnius and enjoy the vicennial ITiCSE conference and Lithuania's Statehood Day!},

abstract = {To accelerate software development, developers frequently search and reuse existing code snippets from a large-scale codebase, e.g., GitHub. Over the years, researchers proposed many information retrieval (IR)-based models for code search, but they fail to connect the semantic gap between query and code. An early successful deep learning (DL)-based model DeepCS solved this issue by learning the relationship between pairs of code methods and corresponding natural language descriptions. Two major advantages of DeepCS are the capability of understanding irrelevant/noisy keywords and capturing sequential relationships between words in query and code. In this article, we proposed an IR-based model CodeMatcher that inherits the advantages of DeepCS (i.e., the capability of understanding the sequential semantics in important query words), while it can leverage the indexing technique in the IR-based model to accelerate the search response time substantially. CodeMatcher first collects metadata for query words to identify irrelevant/noisy ones, then iteratively performs fuzzy search with important query words on the codebase that is indexed by the Elasticsearch tool and finally reranks a set of returned candidate code according to how the tokens in the candidate code snippet sequentially matched the important words in a query. We verified its effectiveness on a large-scale codebase with ~41K repositories. Experimental results showed that CodeMatcher achieves an MRR (a widely used accuracy measure for code search) of 0.60, outperforming DeepCS, CodeHow, and UNIF by 82%, 62%, and 46%, respectively. Our proposed model is over 1.2K times faster than DeepCS. Moreover, CodeMatcher outperforms two existing online search engines (GitHub and Google search) by 46% and 33%, respectively, in terms of MRR. We also observed that: fusing the advantages of IR-based and DL-based models is promising; improving the quality of method naming helps code search, since method name plays an important role in connecting query and code.},

The origins of spoken dialogue systems can be traced back to Artificial Intelligence research in the 1950s concerned with developing conversational interfaces. However, it is only within the last decade or so, with major advances in speech technology, that large-scale working systems have been developed and, in some cases, introduced into commercial environments. As a result many major telecommunications and software companies have become aware of the potential for spoken dialogue technology to provide solutions in newly developing areas such as computer-telephony integration. Voice portals, which provide a speech-based interface between a telephone user and Web-based services, are the most recent application of spoken dialogue technology. This article describes the main components of the technology---speech recognition, language understanding, dialogue management, communication with an external source such as a database, language generation, speech synthesis---and shows how these component technologies can be integrated into a spoken dialogue system. The article describes in detail the methods that have been adopted in some well-known dialogue systems, explores different system architectures, considers issues of specification, design, and evaluation, reviews some currently available dialogue development toolkits, and outlines prospects for future development.},

But as the world of business becomes more interconnected and global, enterprise data is no long a monolith; it is just a part of a vast web of data. Managing data on a world-wide scale is a key capability for any business today.The Semantic Web treats data as a distributed resource on the scale of the World Wide Web, and incorporates features to address the challenges of massive data distribution as part of its basic design. The aim of the first two editions was to motivate the Semantic Web technology stack from end-to-end; to describe not only what the Semantic Web standards are and how they work, but also what their goals are and why they were designed as they are. It tells a coherent story from beginning to end of how the standards work to manage a world-wide distributed web of knowledge in a meaningful way.The third edition builds on this foundation to bring Semantic Web practice to enterprise. Fabien Gandon joins Dean Allemang and Jim Hendler, bringing with him years of experience in global linked data, to open up the story to a modern view of global linked data. While the overall story is the same, the examples have been brought up to date and applied in a modern setting, where enterprise and global data come together as a living, linked network of data. Also included with the third edition, all of the data sets and queries are available online for study and experimentation at data.world/swwo.}

Today public key cryptography provides the primary basis for secure communication over the internet, enabling online work, socializing, shopping, government services, and much more.While other books have documented the development of public key cryptography, this is the first to provide a comprehensive insiders’ perspective on the full impacts of public key cryptography, including six original chapters by nine distinguished scholars. The book begins with an original joint biography of the lives and careers of Diffie and Hellman, highlighting parallels and intersections, and contextualizing their work. Subsequent chapters show how public key cryptography helped establish an open cryptography community and made lasting impacts on computer and network security, theoretical computer science, mathematics, public policy, and society. The volume includes particularly influential articles by Diffie and Hellman, as well as newly transcribed interviews and Turing Award Lectures by both Diffie and Hellman.The contributed chapters provide new insights that are accessible to a wide range of readers, from computer science students and computer security professionals, to historians of technology and members of the general public. The chapters can be readily integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses on a range of topics, including computer security, theoretical computer science and mathematics, the history of computing, and science and technology policy.}

The first volume was published in 1998 as part of the celebration of the 25th SIGGRAPH conference. Seminal Graphics Papers Volume 2, perhaps more than any other activity undertaken in this milestone year, celebrates ACM SIGGRAPH's origins and continued success as a Technical and Professional Society. This collection of papers typifies the ground-breaking research that has been the conference's hallmark since 1974. A quick scan of the chapter and the paper titles shows just how far SIGGRAPH research has pushed the boundaries of our discipline and contributed to its evolution.The ACM Digital Library team has been supportive of this Seminal Graphics Papers project from the beginning. I am pleased to let you know that both Volumes 1 and 2 of Seminal Graphics Papers are freely available from the ACM Digital Library at these URLs: Volume 1: https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.1145/280811Volume 2: https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.1145/3596711}

abstract = {Code Nation explores the rise of software development as a social, cultural, and technical phenomenon in American history. The movement germinated in government and university labs during the 1950s, gained momentum through corporate and counterculture experiments in the 1960s and 1970s, and became a broad-based computer literacy movement in the 1980s. As personal computing came to the fore, learning to program was transformed by a groundswell of popular enthusiasm, exciting new platforms, and an array of commercial practices that have been further amplified by distributed computing and the Internet. The resulting society can be depicted as a “Code Nation”—a globally-connected world that is saturated with computer technology and enchanted by software and its creation.Code Nation is a new history of personal computing that emphasizes the technical and business challenges that software developers faced when building applications for CP/M, MS-DOS, UNIX, Microsoft Windows, the Apple Macintosh, and other emerging platforms. It is a popular history of computing that explores the experiences of novice computer users, tinkerers, hackers, and power users, as well as the ideals and aspirations of leading computer scientists, engineers, educators, and entrepreneurs. Computer book and magazine publishers also played important, if overlooked, roles in the diffusion of new technical skills, and this book highlights their creative work and influence.Code Nation offers a “behind-the-scenes” look at application and operating-system programming practices, the diversity of historic computer languages, the rise of user communities, early attempts to market PC software, and the origins of “enterprise” computing systems. Code samples and over 80 historic photographs support the text. The book concludes with an assessment of contemporary efforts to teach computational thinking to young people.}

Business management, the world of work, administrative life, the nation state, and soon enough everyday life were expected to change dramatically with these machines’ use. Ever since, diverse prophecies of computing have continually emerged, through to the present day.As computing spread beyond the US and UK, such prophecies emerged from strikingly different economic, political, and cultural conditions. This volume explores how these expectations differed, assesses unexpected commonalities, and suggests ways to understand the divergences and convergences.This book examines thirteen countries, based on source material in ten different languages—the effort of an international team of scholars. In addition to analyses of debates, political changes, and popular speculations, we also show a wide range of pictorial representations of “the future with computers.”}

abstract = {By 2006, C++ had been in widespread industrial use for 20 years. It contained parts that had survived unchanged since introduced into C in the early 1970s as well as features that were novel in the early 2000s. From 2006 to 2020, the C++ developer community grew from about 3 million to about 4.5 million. It was a period where new programming models emerged, hardware architectures evolved, new application domains gained massive importance, and quite a few well-financed and professionally marketed languages fought for dominance. How did C++ -- an older language without serious commercial backing -- manage to thrive in the face of all that? This paper focuses on the major changes to the ISO C++ standard for the 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 revisions. The standard library is about 3/4 of the C++20 standard, but this paper's primary focus is on language features and the programming techniques they support. The paper contains long lists of features documenting the growth of C++. Significant technical points are discussed and illustrated with short code fragments. In addition, it presents some failed proposals and the discussions that led to their failure. It offers a perspective on the bewildering flow of facts and features across the years. The emphasis is on the ideas, people, and processes that shaped the language. Themes include efforts to preserve the essence of C++ through evolutionary changes, to simplify its use, to improve support for generic programming, to better support compile-time programming, to extend support for concurrency and parallel programming, and to maintain stable support for decades' old code. The ISO C++ standard evolves through a consensus process. Inevitably, there is competition among proposals and clashes (usually polite ones) over direction, design philosophies, and principles. The committee is now larger and more active than ever, with as many as 250 people turning up to week-long meetings three times a year and many more taking part electronically. We try (not always successfully) to mitigate the effects of design by committee, bureaucratic paralysis, and excessive enthusiasm for a variety of language fashions. Specific language-technical topics include the memory model, concurrency and parallelism, compile-time computation, move-semantics, exceptions, lambda expressions, and modules. Designing a mechanism for specifying a template's requirements on its arguments that is sufficiently flexible and precise yet doesn't impose run-time costs turned out to be hard. The repeated attempts to design ``concepts'' to do that have their roots back in the 1980s and touch upon many key design issues for C++ and for generic programming. The description is based on personal participation in the key events and design decisions, backed by the thousands of papers and hundreds of meeting minutes in the ISO C++ standards committee's archives.},
